The housing shortage in 2010-2011 created a spike in housing prices which over a few years  gave way to price correction as the housing supply situation corrected as the Govt rolled out housing in response. Fast forward 12 years the same thing is happening again, only more severe because this time hdb prices are 25-50% higher than the 2010 peak and resale hdb leases in 2023 are now 10 years shorter than they were a decade ago. Hdb resale prices are therefore pie in the sky now and will certainly face a major correction in the years ahead as the supply situation corrects itself and as the remaining lease periods continue to shorten.",2023-04-17 12:21:59 UTC
3693a077fc7fcf0aa49e5628a19df9ad,"BTO remains a lottery; still over subscribed, supply lagging behind demand, insane construction times etc. In my humble opinion, BTO will not be a significant factor in cooling the ever rising housing prices within the next 5 years.

If you can afford it, and need a roof over your head fast, even if the resale is not as good a deal as say 1 year ago, my advice is to bite the bullet, because urgent housing needs trumps whatever savings you might get from waiting. This is coming from someone who bit the bullet begrudgingly last year. No regrets on hindsight.

Of course, if you can afford to wait, then wait. The housing bubble will burst eventually. No one knows when, but we know it will happen.. eventually.",2023-04-17 09:16:08 UTC
66a3dd0bfe0c418fa7b58e0407b4a396,"I think the current housing situation is quite different from how it is described in the article.

Reality:

\- Resale flat prices have increased for over 30 continuous months. Article says it's cooling but prices are still increasing, just at a slower rate. The previous time someone claimed prices were cooling was in Nov 2022. See ST article published then: [Public and private housing markets show early signs of moderation: Desmond Lee](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/public-and-private-housing-markets-moderated-after-sept-30-cooling-measures-desmond-lee). Been like 5 months of early signs of cooling now? 

\- BTO flat supply remains insufficient to meet demand. There was a severe oversubscription of BTO flats in 2022 with 23k units launched. Should have been obvious to everyone that there is an undersupply. But govt announced that they are going to maintain 23k flats to be launched in 2023. The 100k figure might make it sound like the govt is reacting to the demand. But this figure was [first announced in 2021](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/up-to-23000-bto-flats-to-be-launched-a-year-over-the-next-two-years). So the govt hasn't adjusted the numbers up in response.

\- Wait time for BTO flats can be over 5 to 7 years (Time to win BTO lottery + long construction time)

\- Govt shows no urgency in prioritising BTO flats for those who need it more urgently. The measure they announced in Feb 2023 to prioritise married couples and give them an additional ballot doesn't even go into effect for the May 2023 BTO.",2023-04-17 08:07:34 UTC

The situation now is pretty similar to 2012-early 2019 where rising global interest rates led to a decrease in property prices worldwide.

Around that period the government announced another round of cooling measures and he thought he could wait it out for the price to drop so that it won't hurt so much to get his dream home.

Covid and inflation happened, the rest is history. Now, he doesn't plan to buy another unit anymore because he can't afford to downpay it at all. While the unit he wanted is gone, price of similar the units in the condo is now a good 1.5mil+

5471308cfcd622aaf72fec2c60588385,"&gt; # February BTO launch has lowest number of first-timer applicants since 2020; application rates stabilising: HDB

&gt; SINGAPORE - Fewer first-timer homeseekers applied for the February Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise compared with launches in the last three years - an early indication that application rates have reduced and are stabilising, said the Housing Board.

&gt; The number of such applicants was the lowest since the February 2020 launch, at around half of that in some of the past 11 BTO launches, HDB added in a statement on Monday.

&gt; As at 11am on Monday, 12,493 applicants applied for 3-room and bigger flats, of whom 7,513 were first-timers. This is compared with the 20,252 applicants in February 2020 sales exercise, of whom 14,145 were first-timers.

&gt; A total of 4,428 BTO projects across five BTO projects in Queenstown, Kallang/Whampoa, Jurong West and Tengah are up for sale in the current exercise.

&gt; First-timer applicants who applied for BTO flats in the Ulu Pandan Glades BTO project in the mature estate of Queenstown, the Jurong West Crystal BTO project and Brickland Weave BTO project in Tengah, will have a good chance of securing a flat, said HDB.

&gt; This is because the first-timer application rates across all flat types sit between 0.2 and 1.8, meaning fewer than two applicants are vying for each flat.

&gt; Considering the average rejection rate of 40 per cent seen in previous BTO launches, most applicants will be able to select a flat if the application rate of a project is below 1.7.

&gt; In this launch, the median application rate for first-timer applicants for three-room and bigger flats stands at 1.8, which means almost all will be likely to book a flat.

&gt; Barring a last-minute surge in applications, first-timers applicants gunning for a three-room flat in Ulu Pandan Glades BTO project are all but guaranteed a unit, as it remains the only one that is undersubscribed.

&gt; But those going for four-room flats in two Kallang/Whampoa BTO projects will face tougher competition, with around three applicants for each available flat.

&gt; The Farrer Park Fields BTO project in the mature estate falls under the prime location public housing (PLH) model, which comes with stricter buying and selling conditions, while the Rajah Summit BTO project does not.

&gt; At this stage, applicants can only apply to one flat type in one town. They will only be able to select whether they want a flat in either Farrer Park Fields or Rajah Summit at a later stage.

&gt; Applications will close at 11.59pm on Monday on the HDB flat portal.

&gt; SINGAPORE: There are early indications that application rates for Build-to-Order (BTO) flats have ""reduced and are stabilising"", said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Monday (Mar 6), hours before the February sales exercise closes at the end of the day.

&gt; More than 4,400 new flats were launched for sale this round, spread across five projects in Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Jurong West and Tengah.

&gt; ""The February 2023 sales launch also saw the lowest overall number of flat applicants, particularly first-timer applicants since the February 2020 BTO sales launch, with this number hovering around half of the number of flat applicants in some of the past 11 BTO sales launches,"" HDB said, referring to figures as of 11am on Monday.

&gt; For instance, a total of 12,493 applicants applied for three-room and bigger flats, of whom 7,513 were first-timers. In comparison, there were 20,252 applicants in February 2020, of whom 14,145 were first-timers, it added,

&gt; The median application rates for first-timer applicants for three-room and bigger flats is 1.8, said HDB. This is close to the application rate for the November 2022 BTO sales exercise, which had double the flat supply of this launch.

&gt; The median application rates of 1.8 at the November 2022 launch and 2.0 at the February 2021 launch are the lowest in HDB’s quarterly sales launches in the past three years, said the agency.

&gt; First-timer applicants have a better chance of securing a flat as they get two ballot chances instead of one, and up to 95 per cent of the flat supply is reserved for them.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) will reimburse an estimated S$5.1 million to nearly 900 buyers of a Punggol Build-to-Order (BTO) project after its completion was pushed back by more than a year, HDB said on Saturday (Mar 4).

&gt; Launched in February 2017, Waterway Sunrise II was originally slated for completion by mid-2021 with a Delivery Possession Date (DPD) slated between March and June 2022.

&gt; The DPD refers to the legal contractual date by which HDB is required under the Agreement for Lease to deliver possession of the flat.

&gt; However, the construction timeline of the project was first pushed back due to the failure of its original contractor, Lian Ho Lee Construction, and then by the manpower shortage and supply disruptions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic.

&gt; Waterway Sunrise II is among the ongoing BTO projects that suffered the most delays during the COVID-19 pandemic and is one of two BTO projects, alongside Anchorvale Village in Sengkang, where the total delays have exceeded one year.

&gt; As the DPD was crossed, HDB will be making compensation to Waterway Sunrise II flat buyers for the delay.

&gt; 896 households of Waterway Sunrise II who booked their flat by October 2021 will be eligible for the reimbursement amount, said HDB.

&gt; The flat buyers will receive the reimbursement within two months after completing the flat purchase and accepting the settlement agreement, it added.

&gt; The settlement agreement states the exact reimbursement sum the flat buyer is eligible for, based on the actual period of delay and selling price of the booked flat.

&gt; Flat buyers would typically need to submit proof of their out-of-pocket qualifying expenses to receive the reimbursement.

&gt; But to minimise inconvenience to flat buyers, HDB will be offering to pay all flat buyers of Waterway Sunrise II ""the maximum reimbursement sum that they would be eligible for, without them having to submit any claims/proof of the expenses"".

&gt; Flat buyers of the first four completed blocks have since been reimbursed, said the Housing Board.

&gt; The estimated reimbursement amount for the affected flat buyers of all seven blocks ranges from S$1,000 to S$10,500, it said, adding that the average reimbursement sum would be S$5,750.

&gt; ""The total reimbursement amount for all 896 households is estimated to be $5,156,700,"" HDB added.

&gt; SINGAPORE - First-timer applicants who do not select a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat when invited to do so will be considered second-timers in subsequent flat applications for a year, starting from the August sales exercise.

&gt; The tightening of the rule is meant to reduce the number of people who decline to pick a flat and ensure more efficient allocation, so that those who need a flat can secure it more quickly, said National Development Minister Desmond Lee on Thursday.

&gt; Currently, first-timers will only be moved to the second-timer category for a year when balloting for flats if they do not book a BTO flat twice. Far fewer flats are set aside for second-timers - 5 per cent of four-room and larger flats, versus at least 95 per cent for first-timer families.

&gt; Mr Lee also announced other measures to help first timers secure their home during the debate on his ministry’s budget, including setting aside more flats for a new subset of first-timer families - those with Singaporean children aged 18 and below as well as married couples aged 40 and below.

&gt; From the August BTO exercise, up to 40 per cent of the flat supply will be reserved for this group of applicants, up from 30 per cent now.

&gt; Up to 60 per cent of Sales of Balance Flats (SBF) units will be set aside for them as well, an increase from the current 50 per cent. SBF flats are typically either completed or in various stages of construction.

&gt; Applicants under this new First-Timer (Parents &amp; Married Couples) priority category will also get one additional ballot chance in their BTO and SBF applications, for a total of three ballot chances.

&gt; Various MPs including Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim (Chua Chu Kang GRC), Ms Foo Mee Har (West Coast GRC) and Mr Seah Kian Peng (Marine Parade GRC) asked if more support can be given to help Singaporeans buy their first home amid the strong housing demand and elevated resale prices.

&gt; Help will be provided on several fronts, starting with the ramping up of flat supply in the next few years, said Mr Lee.

&gt; Close to 100,000 homes are expected to be completed between 2023 and 2025 across both the private and public housing markets, he said. Of these, almost 40,000 homes will be completed this year - the highest in the last five years, including pre-Covid-19 years of 2018 and 2029, he added.

&gt; This increased supply should help to alleviate some pressure in the rental market as those who have been waiting for their keys will stop renting, and new homes will provide additional rental supply, said Mr Lee in response to Mr Louis Chua (Sengkang GRC).

&gt; On tightening the rules for BTO flat non-selection, Mr Lee said it strikes a balance between considering the interests of flat applicants with urgent housing needs and being fair to those who successfully balloted for a flat.

&gt; He noted that the drop-out rate for BTO flats has hovered around 40 per cent in the past three years, even as strong housing demand pushed up application rates.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Housing Board will look into improving the new red-themed HDB blocks in Tampines North which have left some residents displeased, after MP Baey Yam Keng said the colour choice was “not appropriate”.

&gt; Photos of one of the blocks, featuring its crimson red tiles and paint, surfaced on social media on Tuesday night, with netizens commenting that they were “spooky” and “like a horror movie”.

&gt; Mr Baey told The Straits Times on Wednesday that he has received feedback from residents and will work with the housing authority on it.

&gt; “Seeing the photos taken at night with dim lighting, I agree with the comments that the block appears eerie. I’ve told HDB that the colour may not be appropriate in an HDB block, and they will look into it,” he said.

&gt; On Tuesday night, the ceilings of the lift lobbies – which were initially painted red – have been painted white. The walls and floor of the lift lobby, as well as the letterbox area, are covered in red tiles.

&gt; The block in question is among 11 blocks in the Tampines GreenVines Build-to-Order (BTO) project, which has three different coloured themes.

&gt; Three yellow-themed blocks were completed in December 2022, and one of the four red-themed blocks was completed recently, Mr Baey added. The other four blocks are themed purplish blue.

&gt; In response to queries, an HDB spokesman said it will also paint some of the red walls white to “tone it down”. It will also do so for the other blocks in the BTO project.

&gt; “The tiled areas will remain to help with way-finding and maintain the precinct identity,” she added, noting that the brightly-coloured lift lobbies are meant to differentiate the clusters of blocks.

&gt; The spokesman said the three colours chosen were inspired by fruits – dragon fruit, mango and mangosteen.

&gt; A resident, who collected her keys this week and wanted to be known only as Ms Nur, 29, a manager, said she thought the lift lobby was “scary and eerie”.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The mature estates of Bedok and Serangoon will get new Housing Board flats for the first time in about seven and nine years respectively, as 1,960 flats will be launched across both towns in the next Build-To-Order (BTO) sales exercise in May.

&gt; Both BTO projects will have five-room flats, which are more commonly offered in non-mature estates and selected mature estates located further from the city centre.

&gt; In Bedok, HDB will build around 1,630 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room, five-room and three-generation flats on a site near Tanah Merah MRT station. The site is bounded by Bedok South Road and Bedok South Avenue 3.

&gt; In Serangoon, 330 four-room and five-room flats will be launched on a site bounded by Serangoon North Avenue 1 and Yio Chu Kang Road. This will be the first provision of larger flats in the mature estate since the BTO system was fully implemented in 2002.

&gt; HDB had last launched new flats in Bedok in November 2016, when it offered 1,655 BTO flats across three BTO projects. Of the three, only one project had five-room flats.

&gt; In January 2014, 150 studio apartments for the elderly were launched in Serangoon.

&gt; One Global Group senior analyst Mohan Sandrasegeran said the inclusion of five-room flats in both mature estates will likely generate considerable interest from potential buyers who have been waiting for such an opportunity.

&gt; “This presents an excellent opportunity for home buyers who are interested in securing a spacious flat,” he added.

&gt; HDB typically offers five-room BTO flats in mature estates such as Tampines, Pasir Ris and Ang Mo Kio, and not in those that are more centrally located such as Queenstown, Bukit Merah and Bishan.

&gt; In the August 2022 sales exercise, BTO projects in Ang Mok Kio and Tampines included five-room flats.

&gt; Five-room flat prices in the Ang Mo Kio BTO project – Central Weave @ AMK – ranged between $713,000 and $877,000, which raised some eyebrows. Despite that, there were more than three first-time applicants vying for each available flat at the close of the sales exercise.

&gt; In May 2023, HDB will offer BTO flats in Tengah and Kallang/Whampoa in addition to Bedok and Serangoon.

&gt; The Board will offer between 5,200 and 6,200 flats in August 2023, in Choa Chu Kang, Tengah, Bukit Merah, Kallang/Whampoa and Queenstown.

&gt; HDB said it is monitoring demand closely and is prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025.

a113bd1cf5aca2e1a7936ff771fdaa22,"&gt; # HDB offers 4,428 BTO flats, including two under prime housing model in Dover Forest, Farrer Park

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Housing Board launched 4,428 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats for sale on Tuesday, including two projects under the prime location public housing (PLH) model in Dover Forest and Farrer Park.

&gt; These two projects – one in the mature estate of Queenstown and the other in the mature estate of Kallang/Whampoa – come with stricter buying and selling conditions, including a 6 per cent subsidy clawback upon their sale.

&gt; There are three other projects in the first sales exercise of the year – another in Kallang/Whampoa that does not come under the PLH model, and in the non-mature estates of Jurong West and Tengah.

&gt; The five projects have a median waiting time of about 4.4 years. HDB said all four-room flats offered in the two non-mature estates are below $400,000, before grants.

&gt; A total of 732 three-room and four-room units are on offer in Ulu Pandan Glades in Queenstown. It is situated in the eastern half of Dover Forest and is near Dover MRT station.

&gt; Prices range from $372,000 to $498,000 – without grants – for a three-room flat, and $541,000 to $711,000 for a four-room flat, making these flats the most expensive in this launch. Buyers will also have to wait the longest for these units, as they will take about 68 months – or around 5.6 years – to be completed.

&gt; Ulu Pandan Glades is the second of three BTO projects to be launched in the eastern half of Dover Forest.

&gt; The first BTO project, Ulu Pandan Banks, also came under the PLH model in the November 2022 sales exercise. Demand was muted, with most first-time applicants likely to have a chance to select a unit. Prices ranged from $362,000 to $504,000 for a three-room flat and $546,000 to $725,000 for a four-room flat in the project, which is nearer to the MRT station than Ulu Pandan Glades.

&gt; The second PLH project in the current sales exercise is Farrer Park Fields, which has 1,274 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats on a site between Little India and Farrer Park MRT stations.

&gt; Prices for this project range from $356,000 to $449,000 for a three-room flat, and $484,000 to $631,000 for a four-room flat. Buyers will have to wait for about 53 months – around 4.4 years.

&gt; The other BTO project in Kallang/Whampoa is Rajah Summit, which offers 510 three-room and four-room flats on a site in Jalan Rajah next to Kallang River.

&gt; Singapore – First-timers buying Housing Board resale flats will get more help, with a housing grant increased by $30,000 for families purchasing four-room or smaller units and by $10,000 for those buying five-room or larger units.

&gt; An additional Build-To-Order (BTO) flat ballot will be given to families with children and young married couples aged 40 and below who are buying their first home, as the Government moves to help more Singaporeans in their home ownership journey.

&gt; These measures are to support the housing aspirations of young Singaporeans, said Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Lawrence Wong in his Budget speech on Tuesday.

&gt; He noted that some Singaporeans are prepared to buy resale flats for their first home, but find resale prices today too expensive.

&gt; Under the revised Central Provident Fund Housing Grant, first-timer families buying two-room, three-room or four-room HDB resale flats can now get $80,000, up from the previous $50,000. Those who buy five-room or larger units can get $50,000, up from the previous $40,000.

&gt; To be eligible for the grant, families must comprise at least two Singapore citizens, or one Singaporean and one Singapore permanent resident. They must not have received any housing subsidies before, do not have a monthly income of more than $14,000 and do not own or have an interest in a private property in the last 30 months prior to the flat application.

&gt; First-timer singles buying HDB resale flats will also get higher CFP housing grants of up to $40,000 for four-room and smaller units, an increase from $25,000 before. Those who buy five-room or larger units can get $25,000, up from the previous $20,000.

&gt; First-timer singles refer to Singapore citizens aged 35 and above who have not received any housing subsidies before, do not have a monthly income of more than $7,000 and do not own or have an interest in a private property in the last 30 months prior to the flat application.

2. If no queue number, or quota runs out before your turn (i.e. didn't get a chance to pick flat), refund $490, hence making it equivalent to the current $10 application fee.
3. If get a chance to select flat but reject, no refund of $500.

&gt; SINGAPORE - First-timers buying Housing Board resale flats could get more help, as the Government mulls over additional support for those who are looking to buy their first home.

&gt; National Development Minister Desmond Lee said on Monday that measures to reduce the high rejection rate for Build-To-Order (BTO) flat applications are also being studied to ensure new flats are prioritised for those with genuine and urgent housing needs. HDB data shows that 40 per cent of applicants invited to book a BTO flat over the past five years ended up not selecting their flat.

&gt; In his speech on his motion on affordable and accessible public housing, Mr Lee reiterated that the Government is studying how to provide even more support for those looking to buy their first homes, and will announce these new measures when ready. “We are doing our utmost to improve the accessibility and affordability of HDB flats,” he said. “We know that policies cannot remain static as the aspirations and needs of our people change.”

&gt; Mr Lee had filed his motion in response to a separate one by Progress Singapore Party (PSP) Non-Constituency MPs Leong Mun Wai and Hazel Poa.

&gt; Acknowledging that Singaporeans are unhappy about the long waiting times and delays of BTO flats in recent years due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Mr Lee said HDB has been catching up on delayed projects.

&gt; Outlining the Government’s plans to meet the supply crunch, he noted that more than 23,000 flats were completed in 2022, with another 23,000 flats slated to be handed over to buyers in 2023.

&gt; More BTO flats with shorter waiting times of under three years will also be launched from 2024 onwards, he said, adding that the Government aims to roll out around 2,000 to 3,000 of such flats each year by 2025, similar to pre-Covid-19 levels. “After that, over a period of time, we will recalibrate our building programme so that shorter waiting time flats form a larger proportion of our supply of new flats,” said Mr Lee.

589df4e1bc6550a1c5156bf375baeed3,"&gt; # Proportion of delayed BTO projects down from 90% to 40%, HDB expects to clear backlog in 2 years

&gt; SINGAPORE – About 40 per cent of ongoing Build-To-Order (BTO) projects are delayed owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, and the Housing Board said it expects to clear the backlog in about two years.

&gt; HDB on Saturday said the proportion of such delayed BTO projects has come down from more than 90 per cent in 2021 on the back of the improving Covid-19 and migrant manpower situation, as well as government support for the construction industry.

&gt; In the past two years, HDB has completed 55 per cent of BTO projects – or 52 projects – delayed by pandemic-related factors. This project completion rate is the highest in the past five years, said HDB chief executive Tan Meng Dui.

&gt; “Over the next two years, we will continue to work hard to minimise delays of our BTO projects and press on to deliver more homes to our flat buyers, without compromising safety and quality,” he said.

&gt; The first BTO project to be completed without any delays since the pandemic began will be ready by the first quarter of 2023, said HDB.

&gt; Keat Hong Verge, located in the non-mature estate of Choa Chu Kang, has 987 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units across five blocks.

&gt; HDB noted that flat owners would have waited just slightly over two years for their units in this project when they get their keys, despite its August 2020 launch at a time when the construction industry was suffering a manpower and supply crunch.

&gt; Since 2018, HDB has been offering some BTO flats with shorter waiting times of less than three years by starting construction works before launching the projects.

&gt; To date, close to 11,000 flats with shorter waiting times have been launched. Of these, about 7,200 flats were launched between 2020 and 2022.

&gt; Although the pandemic affected the pipeline of such BTO flats with shorter waiting times, HDB said it aims to launch more of such flats in the future.

&gt; HDB said that up until about a year ago, it had a shortage of 25 per cent of the workforce needed to build BTO projects, because of various Covid-19 measures and restrictions.

&gt; To help contractors reduce construction delays, HDB sourced workers from overseas and helped them enter Singapore safely to tackle labour shortages. The board also shouldered some of the Covid-19-related cost increases.

&gt; Senior project director Chua Hoe Seang, 65, who oversaw the construction of the Tampines GreenVerge BTO project, said his project would most likely have been further delayed if not for the skilled foreign workers whom HDB helped bring into Singapore during the pandemic.

&gt; The company he works for, Kay Lim Construction and Trading, now has four BTO projects under its belt, with construction activities almost back to pre-Covid-19 levels.

&gt;Recent media reports of seemingly vacant Build-To-Order (BTO) flats put up for sale on property portals have got some Singaporeans up in arms.  
&gt;  
&gt;These flats are completely bare and unrenovated, with no apparent signs of having been lived in during the mandatory five-year minimum occupation period (MOP).On Thursday, the Housing Board said 53 errant flat owners who did not live in their flats during the MOP had been taken to task in the last six years. This translates to less than nine each year, a minority given that there are more than one million HDB flats in Singapore.  
&gt;  
&gt;But these MOP breaches have irked some Singaporeans, with online reaction ranging from anger towards the flat owners to disappointment in the inadequacy of public housing policies to stamp out such unlawful practices.  
&gt;  
&gt;The public outcry reflects broader unhappiness over public housing issues and the difficulties that some Singaporeans face in getting their BTO flats.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the past two years, application rates for BTO flats, which are launched for sale by the HDB four times a year and allocated via balloting, have risen sharply. This is partly driven by a cohort of millennials reaching marriageable age and seeking their first home, the growing trend of smaller households, and the attractive BTO projects in mature estates on offer.  
&gt;  
&gt;Anecdotally, it is not uncommon to hear of Singaporeans who have failed many times in their BTO applications, some of whom eventually give up and turn to the HDB resale market where home prices are higher.  
&gt;  
&gt;Thus, it understandably does not sit well with many to see a group of owners who are lucky enough to buy a BTO flat even though they do not need to live in them, and yet are hoping to sell them for a profit.  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, Singaporeans are fed up with people gaming the public housing system.  
&gt;  
&gt;When it comes to detecting such ""vacant BTO flats, much relies on the public to raise any suspicious misuse of flats via a toll-free hotline, which will then prompt the HDB to investigate.  
&gt;  
&gt;But how many people are willing to tattle on their neighbour?  
&gt;  
&gt;While the HDB conducts around 500 inspections monthly to detect violations of housing rules, these are likely more of a deterrence and there may well be rule-breakers who go undetected.  
&gt;  
&gt;This raises the question: Is there a more efficient way of detecting such cases instead of relying on public feedback, which may be unreliable and sporadic?Netizens have raised the possibility of the HDB requesting monthly utilities bills, prior to the completion of any resale transaction, to see if HDB flats were occupied. But this may complicate paperwork and could run the risk of being too intrusive.  
&gt;  
&gt;A more effective way could be to go after the property agents who may knowingly or unknowingly assist this groupd of owners in selling their flats.Agents who come across these seemingly vacant flats should probe their sellers for further details, and report any suspicions to the HDB.  
&gt;  
&gt;The board has said that every HDB flat sold on the open market is inspected as part of the selling process, and tell-tale signs of a home that has not been lived in will be investigated.  
&gt;  
&gt;While owners who allow their flats to sit empty for years but have no intention of selling will likely not be detected, these cases should be in the minority, as the opportunity costs of tying one's name to an unutilised HDB flat do not make such financial sense.  
&gt;  
&gt;There may also be owners who choose to forgo an agent's service, but navigating the resale process on their own will likely already pose some difficulties in selling.In 2021, over 31,000 HDB flats were sold on the resale market.  
&gt;  
&gt;The matter of ""vacant"" BTO flats on sale comes as the affordability of HDB resale flats and the pricing and availability of BTO flats have been in the spotlight in recent months.  
&gt;  
&gt;In a recent interview with the Straits Times and Lianhe Zaobao, National Development Minster Desmond Lee said his ministry is looking into various aspects of public housing policies as part of the Forward Singapore exercise, and is prepared to consider major changes to meet the needs of the times - including possibly relooking the allocation of flats to prioritise first-time applicants with pressing housing needs.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) is investigating cases of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats being put up for sale after they were left vacant for years.

&gt; Between 2017 and November this year, HDB has taken enforcement action against 53 cases where flat owners did not occupy their flats during the minimum occupation period (MOP), the Housing Board said on Thursday (Dec 22).

&gt; Of these, 21 cases involved HDB taking back the flats, with the rest being issued fines or warnings.

&gt; In response to CNA’s queries, HDB said it is aware of property listings of “vacant” BTO flats being sold on the open market.

&gt; “This includes the cases mentioned in recent media reports, some of which have already been under investigation at the time of media’s reporting,” it said.

&gt; Reports this week showed a BTO flat in Yishun being put up for sale after being left vacant for eight years. There were also reports of other empty BTO flats that appear to have never been lived in being listed for sale on property portals.

&gt; According to HDB’s MOP rules, owners are required to live in the BTO flat before they can sell it on the open market.

&gt; During the MOP, owners are not allowed to sell or rent out the whole flat, or buy a private home. This applies to flats bought from HDB or on the resale market.

&gt; HDB said it carries out about 500 inspections per month to detect violations of housing rules, such as illegal flat rentals.

&gt; Should it receive feedback on suspected cases of violations, such as flats being listed for sale without being occupied by their owners, investigations will be carried out.

&gt; On Monday, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said he was asked if a family can buy a BTO flat and not live in it for five years before selling it as ""almost brand new"" on the resale market.

&gt; ""The answer is no. A BTO flat must be owner-occupied for the full MOP period. If the owners are unable to fulfil the MOP, then the flat needs to be returned to HDB,” he wrote in a Facebook post.

&gt; “HDB will then put up as a balance flat for other home buyers to apply for.”

&gt; WHAT ARE THE PENALTIES?

&gt; If investigations conclude that a flat was not owner-occupied during the MOP, HDB may “compulsorily acquire” the flat, impose a financial penalty of up to S$50,000 or issue written warnings.

&gt; Flats that are compulsorily acquired by HDB under these circumstances will also be put up for sale as sale of balance flats.

398e0c4e4d254295e4ad5ea2a6388430,"Eh look my ex-sector. Another complicated topic. So here we go.

Reasons for delays:

1. Insufficient Competition
2. Brain-drain

**1. Insufficient Competition**

Unlike the construction sector in places like Australia or New Zealand or in fact most of the west that are largely booming with locals, ours is in a rather sorry state compared to theirs.

Think about it, how many big construction companies do we **really** have?

I am not referring to Kingsmen or RedWood or all these weird contracting firms that don't actually do much besides outsource 90% of the work to sub-contractors.

How many do we really have that actually have Singaporeans, Civil Engineers, Architects, QS that form the core company and undertake large-scale projects.

I can only think of the following:

1. Wohhup
2. CPG
3. Obayashi
4. BHCC
5. WeeHur (maybe?)
6. Forgot the rest le

When it comes to the true big-size construction firms that can actually do the work, we tend not to actually have alot of them that actually can do it. This is why you tend to see some of these contractors that win tenders come from overseas like Malaysia, China, Japan etc.

The money from our government actually experiences out-flow from the country when these guys win the tender. They usually win because they have overseas projects in their home country that act as a stable form of income, so they can venture out to win/lose tenders accordingly without going under.

From this, you can probably guess that there simply aren't enough tenderers for such projects. Not enough tenders -&gt; Firms collapse -&gt; Not enough tenderers -&gt; You need more HDB suddenly -&gt; Cannot build because those who can got no capacity to take on more.

**2. Brain-drain**

You can probably guess how this happens:

*Money la if not what?*

You have a sector that is one of the least-paying ones, with the need to go down to site, potentially get exposed to hazards that you don't know how it will impact your health and the best part is... You get to work 5.5 days a week or even 6!

Don't let me get started on COVID-19. While it can be said that most sectors were impacted by COVID-19. The construction sector downright nearly died from it. I can recall the buzzing phones of my ex-bosses when construction work was going to stop, the true fear that the entire firm will literally go under in just a month or so.

These firms survive on loans and cashflow, the moment cashflow stops, the local firms die. (not the international ones)

**In Singapore, if you lose the tender, it is not uncommon to find Civil Engineers go months with pay-cut or even with no pay.** I have had one acquaintence become a Grab/Foodpanda driver because there was no income during COVID. (though this can be said for everyone)

At the university level (NUS) where I graduated, I only know of... One? or Two? people that actually stay in the sector?

The rest has already fled either to Finance or Tech. Some fled to Public Service because it's the best option when the local sector is dead or on life-support.

&gt; SINGAPORE: It is a ""key national priority"" to keep public housing affordable so that Singaporeans can own their homes, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) said on Wednesday (Dec 7).

&gt; The Housing Board said this in response to queries on how Build-to-Order (BTO) flat prices are determined, and their development costs.

&gt; In a statement issued to the media, HDB went into some detail about how new flats are priced, emphasising that it prices the flats with ""affordability in mind"". This is unlike the private sector, which is profit-driven, it said.

&gt; ""We therefore do not apply a profit margin on costs. To determine housing affordability, we look at the buyers’ household incomes and the selling prices of the flats on offer,"" said HDB.

&gt; While the pricing process has long been established, questions have been raised recently about the continued affordability of HDB BTO flats as prices of new launches hit new highs. Five-room and larger new flats for Central Weave @ AMK, launched in August, started at more than S$700,000 and some topped S$800,000.

&gt; HDB said that in pricing new BTO flats, it first establishes the market value of the flats by considering the prices of comparable resale flats nearby.

&gt; This is influenced by prevailing market conditions, as well as the individual attributes of the flats. These attributes can include location, floor height, tenure, flat features and the amenities nearby.

They have to use a bigger portion of their salary to fund their public housing.

Also, even before young couples worry about the financial burden, they need to get lucky to get a queue number. Next, they have to worry about getting a place to stay while their BTO flat is being constructed. Can be as long as a 7 years wait! Anyone can easily see there are so many problems with the current system.

If the wait for a BTO flat is too long, which obviously it is, young couples face a much bigger financial burden funding a resale flat. Resale flat prices have increased for 28 straight months!

&gt; SINGAPORE – Build-to-Order (BTO) flats are priced such that they remain affordable for buyers – an approach that is “fundamentally different” from private developers, who price their residential units for profit, said the Housing Board on Wednesday.

&gt; In a statement, HDB added that as BTO flats are highly subsidised, their selling prices cannot fully cover development costs, which include construction and land costs.

&gt; In the 2021-2022 financial year, the total development costs for the 13,506 new flats HDB handed over to buyers came up to $5.346 billion.

&gt; Giving a breakdown of development costs, HDB said the bulk – $3.167 billion – went to land costs, while $2.077 billion went into building costs. The remaining $102 million was incurred when HDB acquired flats from former owners.

&gt; HDB’s statement comes after the issue of affordability and pricing of BTO flats was raised multiple times in recent months, including in Parliament.

&gt; In November, Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh had pressed Second Minister for Finance and National Development Indranee Rajah for details of the development costs of BTO flats and subsidies provided to buyers, with the minister saying it was not meaningful to provide such information as what mattered was whether people could afford a flat.

&gt; Following that exchange, netizens had called for HDB to be more transparent about the way it prices new flats.

&gt; On Wednesday, HDB detailed how it prices BTO flats and contrasted its approach with private residential developers, which it said price for profit.

&gt; “HDB’s flat pricing approach is totally separate and independent of the BTO projects’ development costs,” the Board said, citing how it increased subsidies to keep flat prices relatively stable, amid rising property prices and construction costs increasing by nearly 30 per cent due to Covid-19-related factors.

&gt; All subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as BTO flats.

&gt; HDB noted that the increase in BTO flat prices over the last decade has kept within the growth in household incomes.

&gt; From 2012 to 2021, the median resident employed household income grew by 26 per cent, while incomes for those in the second-lowest income bracket grew at a faster rate of 32 per cent during that period, it said.

&gt; In comparison, the average selling price per square foot (psf) of a BTO flat in mature estates grew 22 per cent from 2012 to the first three quarters of 2022 - from $479 to $584. Those in non-mature estates grew 16 per cent from $311 to $362.

&gt; HDB’s flat pricing approach and costs are also available to the public, unlike private residential developers, said the board.

1. HDB makes a loss due to land cost. Government highlight their ability to grow the reserves. Net, government get to claim contribution to both providing affordable pricing and growing the reserves.

2. Avaliabilty of land is kept low to prop up land sales prices. Then HDB land cost are computed using these land prices as part of the formula. Net, high land cost for both private and hdb. 

3. Private properties are priced higher due to land price. Buyers cannot afford private, therfore resale goes up. Net, government claim contribution to asset enhancement.

4. Resale prices goes up, resale prices are used as part of formula for bto pricing. Bto prices goes up. Government provide more subsidy. Net, government claim contribution to helping families with rising cost.

&gt; Every day I see news of rising prices and “monitoring” and I can’t help but resignedly wonder if young Singaporeans are getting the short end of the stick due to inaction from our Government, and a preference for the older, home-owning voter base. :(

The meteoric rise that is even seen in your chart is between 2019-2021. Guess what is happening during that makes fixing the supply almost impossible?

There’s really nothing much the gov can feasibly do during this whole period other than doing small tweaks to stuff, as there’s always a danger of overcorrection to the market when the covid restrictions drop and supply starts easing.

Of course their worry of overcorrecting here is tied to their desire to maintain the flats as assets, but that’s the current reality of the market now. 

Without a paradigm shift in the way we deal with flats that needs to be implemented over a long period in future, the overcorrection would deal loads of unwanted damage to our current economy; and that’s going to be compounded in the current global economical state.

2f7175aec4533be8cc0fffee3ee76726,"&gt; # First-time BTO applicants in November HDB launch have good chance of booking Queenstown flats

&gt; SINGAPORE - First-time applicants for the Queenstown build-to-order (BTO) projects in the November launch stand a good chance of being invited to select a flat, while those who opted for the Kallang/Whampoa BTO project face stiff competition.

&gt; As at 2pm on Thursday, the first-timer application rate in Queenstown stood at 0.3 for three-room flats and 1.3 for four-room flats, suggesting muted demand for the three BTO projects in the estate.

&gt; Historical data from the Housing Board shows that most first-time applicants for BTO projects with an application rate of 1.7 or lower have a good chance to book a flat after accounting for a 40 per cent dropout rate.

&gt; Of the three BTO projects in Queenstown, two - Ulu Pandan Banks and Ghim Moh Natura - fall under the prime location public housing (PLH) model, which comes with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; The third project, Queenstown Canopy, does not fall under the PLH model as the site - next to Alexandra Hospital - is farther from the main transport nodes and major retail amenities.

&gt; At this application stage, applicants can choose only their preferred flat size and their application covers all projects in Queenstown offered in the November launch. They get to choose which one of the three projects they prefer only at the flat selection stage.

&gt; The popular development in this November launch is the Kallang Horizon BTO project, which falls under the PLH model in the mature estate of Kallang/Whampoa.

&gt; More than six first-timers are vying for each of the four-room flats on offer, while there are three first-timers for each three-room flat.

&gt; Eventual owners of flats in the three PLH projects must pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they sell their homes on the open market for the first time.

&gt; The subsidy clawback applies to the first resale transaction and not to subsequent sales because of the higher amount of subsidies given to first-time owners.

&gt; Owners will also be bound by a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) before they can sell their flats on the open market. Standard BTO flats come with a five-year MOP and do not have a subsidy clawback clause.

&gt; Owners are also not allowed to rent out their whole unit, even after the MOP.

&gt; Demand was quite evenly spread out across the six BTO projects in the non-mature estates of Bukit Batok, Tengah and Yishun.

b385c88b74bca08fa3d25c6ce4b9d908,"Nice try with the ‘biggest sales exercise’ when the backlogs from application to selecting a flat is as massive as ever. And this bottleneck is causing a vicious cycle.

Example: Aug 2022 bto, some projects only start selection in Jan 2023. Which means they are free to also apply Nov22 and even Feb23 exercise when they are already holding a queue, just because the selection date is so many months later. This further inflate the already oversubscribed rates, which also explains why even when the selection is only halfway through with lots of desirable units, you still see a high % of drop out rates.

Sbf is even worse. Used to have to wait 6 weeks for balloting results to be out, now the sbf nov22 results will only be out by mid-feb I.e. 12 weeks. Some people applied sbf in may22 and the selection appt is in nov22. That’s another ~6 months wait. 

If hdb can ensure selection is done within 3 months from launch, this can at least eliminate a big portion of people from having to apply and apply the next exercise when they already hold a number which further worsen the oversubscription problem. But somehow this bottleneck has never been solved and has worsened.

Remember in Jun 2022 there were articles by HDB saying “First-timers have good chance to book BTO flat as 40% of applicants invited to do so decline”, making it seems like majority of the applicants are picky? The fact is hdb has a big role to play for such a high dropout rate.

Unless you’re actually actively involved in applying for a flat, you’ll never hear the actual stories. I’m tired of outsiders who keep shitting on the applicants calling them picky and blaming them for ‘only applying for matured estates so don’t complain you can’t get a flat after X number of tries’. How about these Govt ass-kissing boomers who offloaded their overpriced flats to next poor young couple, get their heads out of the cloud and realise that we don’t care whether it’s matured or non-matured, we just want something that is within walking distance to mrt and have basic amenities before dropping half a million in a flat we will hold for at least the next 10 years and raise our kids in?

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Housing Board launched 9,655 Build-To-Order flats for sale on Wednesday, in what was the biggest sales exercise since the BTO system was implemented in 2002.

&gt; The units are spread across 10 housing projects in five estates. Three of these - two in Queenstown and one in Kallang/Whampoa - fall under the prime location public housing (PLH) model, which comes with a 6 per cent subsidy clawback upon their sale.

&gt; Another 1,071 flats are on offer in this year’s second and last Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) scheme, bringing the total number of new flats on sale in this launch to 10,726.

&gt; To allow buyers more time to select their units, the application period has been extended to nine days, up from the usual seven days, said HDB on Wednesday.

&gt; HDB launched 23,184 BTO flats in 2022, up from 17,000 flats in 2021, to meet strong demand for public housing.

&gt; In the current sales exercise, two projects in the mature estate of Queenstown under the PLH model come with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; The bigger of the two is Ulu Pandan Banks, with 1,330 three-room and four-room flats on offer across seven blocks. It is situated in the eastern half of Dover Forest, within walking distance of Dover MRT station.

&gt; The four blocks facing Ulu Pandan Canal will be low-rise, while those closer to Commonwealth Avenue West will be high-rise.

&gt; Prices for this project range from $362,000 to $504,000 - without grants - for a three-room flat, and from $546,000 to $725,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 71 months - close to six years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2029 - making it the project with the longest waiting time in this launch.

&gt; The second Queenstown project under the PLH model is Ghim Moh Natura, where 991 two-room flexi, three-room and four-flats across four blocks are on offer on a site near Buona Vista MRT station.

6a6264a15f58bb9ff652326901fe868f,"&gt; # HDB to launch 9,500 BTO flats on Nov 23; 3 projects under prime housing model

&gt; SINGAPORE - Three out of nine Build-To-Order (BTO) projects to be launched in the November sales exercise will come under the prime location public housing (PLH) model.

&gt; Two - Ulu Pandan Banks and Ghim Moh Natura - are in the mature estate of Queenstown. The third is Kallang Horizon in Kallang Whampoa, also a mature estate.

&gt; The sales exercise will begin on Nov 23, with the Housing Board launching over 9,500 units, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said in a Facebook post on Thursday.

&gt; Flat owners of the three PLH projects will have to pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they sell their home on the open market for the first time under a subsidy clawback clause.

&gt; Owners will also be subject to a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) before they can sell their flats on the open market. Standard BTO flats come with a five-year MOP and do not have a subsidy clawback clause.

&gt; A third project in Queenstown, Queensway Canopy, will not fall under the PLH model as it is located further away from main transport nodes and major retail amenities, Mr Lee said.

&gt; “These flats thus have lower market values than the PLH flats at Ulu Pandan Banks and Ghim Moh Natura,” he said, adding that Queensway Canopy residents will still have access to essential amenities, such as supermarkets and food centres.

&gt; Mr Lee noted that the three PLH projects are located near transport nodes like Dover, Buona Vista and Kallang MRT stations, and are well-served by existing amenities and facilities.

&gt; “Given the attractive locations and attributes, these flats would naturally command higher market values. To keep such PLH projects affordable and accessible, we apply an additional subsidy, on top of the substantial subsidies already provided for all BTO flats,” he said.

&gt; On Nov 23, BTO projects will also be launched in Bukit Batok, Tengah and Yishun.

&gt; The two projects in Tengah, comprising a total of 2,070 units, will trial a beamless flat design that will give residents greater flexibility to configure the layout of their flat.

&gt; There is one project in Bukit Batok and three projects in Yishun.

That has become much stricter since and I've heard they reject consecutive requests. Ironically, it is also against the rules to leave a HDB unit vacant so it's kinda a weird situation some find themselves in.

eb43882a9aee52fd0ff3a5278a8b15ca,"According to HDB CEO Tan Meng Dui, BTO prices are not priced on the development costs (land + construction). Instead, BTO prices are based on market prices of comparable resale flats nearby, with a markdown (subsidy). 

From my understanding, land prices don't exactly determine BTO prices. The culprit is the resale prices, which had inflated significantly over the past 3 years. That's why the govt is trying to apply cooling measures to reduce demand for resale flats. 

So don't whack HDB about land prices la ... They don't even determine the price of BTO using land prices.

That being said, I understand that HDB appears unnecessarily contrived when it tries to justify its efforts using its deficits.

The entire housing market is connected. In land-scarce Singapore, there's only so much land you can build on. When somebody buys up 20 condo units to park his money, it displaces 20 other buyers who would now pay a million dollars for a HDB maisonette; and they in turn displace another tier of buyers who would now bid for a smaller flat at a price they were originally going to put towards a maisonette; and so on and so forth until it filters all the way down to the couple trying to buy their marital home.

0360ca9ef46a10709babf1843d06d2ff,"Fixating on the financial sheets of *one* agency and losing track of the greater issues at hand is appalling, to say the least.

If we look at what this deficit pays for, is it so bad if there is a deficit?

Firstly, this is *subsidised* public housing, and this is what the government has marketed HDB flats as! Deficits are *expected*, isn’t it? If you have a ballooning property market and high land price that outpaces households’ income, isn’t it *expected* for the deficit to grow? If not, it would in effect be a relative reduction in the subsidies given to the people, and thus making public housing less affordable over time.

So what is the government’s goal towards public housing? If it is about retaining affordability (as they claimed), then why harp on the deficit? If they want the financial sheets to look nicer, then they will have to subsidise less and hurt affordability, then they can’t claim they “care” about affordability. If they want both, then go and rein in the housing markets and stop monitoring.

Secondly, what is this land cost? It is said that HDB land costs are high because if state land were given to HDB cheaply, future governments would be less inclined to set aside land for public housing when they can sell it to private developers for funds.

Okay, while that makes some sense, where does the money go? It goes back to the government, *technically* not *this* government, but to *future* governments. Proceeds from land sales goes to the reserves, “national savings” that can be utilised in time of need (such as the covid budgets that helped weathered some economic impact of covid).

Thus, the present government has little incentive to preferentially sell land to private developers, since the present government (theoretically) cannot easily access the reserves anyway. And since the URA and HDB *falls under the same ministry*, which is the Ministry of National Development, why would the *same minister* sabotage his own portfolio for little gain?

Thirdly, even if land costs are high, so what? It helps to subsidise homebuyers and ensure affordability, which is a good thing to spend tax money on (collect more from richer people, spend more on poorer people, as they claimed when raising GST). Furthermore, it helps to build up the reserves, which is also a good thing (hey, the government drew on the reserves during covid, don’t come back and tell us contributing to the reserves is a bad thing now).

Indirectly, the deficit will have further downstream benefits. Lower BTO prices could translate to lower resale prices, since if BTO prices are even lower, the difference between resale and BTO prices will become bigger, which incentivises supply and thus create a downward pressure on resale prices. This also helps to mitigate the long wait needed to get a BTO flat, by making the alternative (resale) more accessible for time sensitive homebuyers, since they refuse to abandon the now inflexible BTO system (that was meant to be flexible).

Lower BTO prices would also lower the percentage of income spent on housing, giving people more disposable income to spend, which can also boost the economy slightly and make people a little bit happier. It could also allow people to have more savings, which is not a bad thing (importance of saving is a motivation behind the CPF system, so don’t tell me that’s not worth considering).

The deficit doesn’t totally disappear. Part of it goes into the reserves through the land costs, and more reserves would give our sovereign wealth funds more money to manage, and thus more investment returns. Some of the investment returns do go back to the Budget, as part of their contribution, while the rest continues to grow for the benefit of Singapore’s future.

If I were to stretch it further, cheaper BTO prices would even help birth rate, since so many people complained that *cost of living* is a negative factor on their choice to have kids.

Long story short, this argument from HDB is a *short-sighted and narrow one*. It fixates on a small part of the government’s goal (responsible spending), but failed to consider the greater and long-term picture (subsidies and wealth transfer, future resilience, social impact, etc.).

Not all deficits are *bad*. As with the argument for GST increases, taxes does not just fund the government’s operating expenses, they fund wealth transfers too. When you are doing wealth transfers, *you are expected to have some deficit, are you not?*",2022-10-04 11:14:21 UTC

So if someone buys HDB for $400,000, but comparable resales are worth $600,000, then when they sell 10 years later for $800,000, they only keep 2/3 the gain because the other 1/3 was paid for by HDB.

The article cites [99.co](https://99.co)'s head of research saying that ""BTO flats remain affordable to buyers despite climbing prices because housing grants have become more generous over the years"", with the new Enhanced Housing Grant. But this isn't the crux of the issue. So what if housing grants increase over the years but wages remain largely stagnant? Does that make BTO flats more 'affordable'? Affordability should be defined in part by looking at wages versus housing prices. But the article conveniently sidesteps this issue. 

The second point is that the narrative surrounding our housing market tends towards over-generalizations, e.g. ""willing buyer willing seller"" or ""it's a free market"". But this is not the case. Most of our land is state land. The government sets prices for BTO units, thus influencing the HDB resale market as well. To say that the valuation of BTO units is tied to the resale market is accurate. But what this means essentially a potentially vicious cycle of price increases.

d7cd0af8f0536a8f28062c1c1b8ad62e,"&gt; # POFMA correction direction issued to The Alternative View for implying HDB profits from Ang Mo Kio BTO flats

&gt; SINGAPORE: Facebook page The Alternative View has been issued a correction direction for suggesting that the Housing &amp; Development Board (HDB) profits from the sale of Build-to-Order (BTO) flats at Central Weave @ AMK.

&gt; The direction was issued under the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).

&gt; The case involved a Facebook post three days ago, said the Ministry of National Development (MND) in a news release on Sunday (Sep 3).

&gt; In the post, The Alternative View reproduced the headline of an AsiaOne article stating ""Ang Mo Kio BTO flats: Strong demand for 5-room units despite prices of up to $877k"". The post contained an image of the Minister for National Development Desmond Lee holding a bag of money.

&gt; The post also included a caption: ""How much profit is HDB reaping from this?""

&gt; MND said in its news release: ""Implicitly this post is stating that HDB is making profit from the sale of the Central Weave @ AMK Build-to-Order (BTO) flats, which are part of the August 2022 BTO sales exercise.

&gt; ""This statement is false.""

&gt; The Alternative View will be required to publish a correction notice and provide access to the correct facts.

&gt; HDB will not profit from the sale of the flats, MND said.

&gt; ""In fact, it will incur a loss from this project, as the estimated amount to be collected from the sale is lower than the estimated total development cost of the project.

&gt; ""If we take into account the CPF housing grants that HDB will extend to eligible buyers, the deficit is higher still,"" MND said.

&gt; The HDB incurs a deficit every year, MND said, adding that ""the amount HDB collects from the sale of flats in every financial year is less than the costs it incurs, including the total development cost (comprising land cost and construction cost) and CPF housing grants"".

&gt; For the financial year 2021/2022, HDB incurred a deficit of S$3.85 billion in its Homeownership Programme.

&gt; In the last three years, the average deficit incurred by HDB was about S$2.68 billion per year.

&gt; The deficit is mainly due to ""significant subsidies"" for new flats and the disbursement of CPF housing grants for eligible buyers, MND said.

&gt; ""Because of this, most first-timer buyers use less than a quarter of their monthly income to service their housing loans.

&gt; ""Close to 90 per cent of first-timer families service their HDB loans using CPF with little or no cash payments,"" the ministry said.

&gt; The annual deficit is funded by the Government and is reflected in HDB's audited financial statements published every year, MND added.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Housing Board launched a total of 4,993 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats for sale on Tuesday (Aug 30), including two projects in Bukit Merah under the prime location public housing (PLH) model, which comes with a six per cent subsidy clawback upon their sale.

&gt; The units are spread across seven housing projects in six estates in the third sales exercise of the year.

&gt; The two projects in the mature estate of Bukit Merah under the PLH model come with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; The smaller of the two is Alexandra Vale, with782 three-room and four-room flats on offer across two blocks on a site next to Redhill MRT station. One of the blocks will house some rental flats.

&gt; Prices for this project range from $385,000 to $477,000, without grants, for a three-room flat, and $547,000 to $705,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 61 months - five years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2028.

&gt; The bigger PLH project is Havelock Hillside, with 869 three-room and four-room flats on offer across two blocks on a site along Havelock Road, within walking distance to Tiong Bahru MRT station. It will also be served by the upcoming Havelock MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast Line.

&gt; Prices for this project range from $370,000 to $515,000 for a three-room flat, and $531,000 to $730,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 68 months - 5.6 years - for these flats, as the project is estimated forcompletion in the fourth quarter of 2028.

&gt; The previous Bukit Merah BTO project launched in May was also under the PLH model and drew considerable buyers' interest due to its proximity to both Redhill and Tiong Bahru MRT stations.

&gt; Flat owners of both Bukit Merah BTO projects in this launch will have to pay six per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they sell their home on the open market for the first time. The subsidy clawback applies to only the first resale transaction and does not apply to subsequent sales, because of the higher amount of subsidies given to the first-time owner of the flat.

&gt; Owners will also be subject to a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP) before they can sell their flats on the open market.

&gt; Standard BTO flats come with a five-year MOP and do not have a subsidy clawback clause.

&gt; In the mature estate of Ang Mo Kio, 896 two-room flexi, four-room, five-room and three-generation flats are on sale across five blocks at Central Weave @ Ang Mo Kio.

&gt; Prices range from $535,000 to $676,000 for a four-room and $720,000 to $877,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 60 months - five years - for these flats, as the project is estimated for completion in the second quarter of 2028.

&gt; The project is bounded by Ang Mo Kio Avenue 8 and Ang Mo Kio Central 2 and 3 and is about a 10-minute walk from Ang Mo Kio MRT station on the North-South Line.

&gt; The 606 Ang Mo Kio households affected by the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) will have the option of applying for these flats.

&gt; Up to 10 per cent of the flat supply in this project will be set aside for priority allocation under the Resettlement, Relocation, Sers and Tenants' Priority Scheme.

&gt; In the mature estate of Tampines, 267 four-room and five-room flats are on offer at Sun Plaza Spring, on a site bounded by Tampines Street 41 and Tampines Street 42.

&gt; Prices start from $381,000 for a four-room and $520,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 36 months - three years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2026.

&gt; There are three projects in non-mature estates in this launch, where at least 95 per cent of the four-room and larger flats and at least 85 per cent of three-room flats are set aside for first-timer families.

&gt; In Woodlands, 630 two-room, three-room and four-room flats are on offer across six blocks at Woodlands South Plains. The site sits along Woodlands Avenue 1 and is served by Woodlands South MRT station on the Thomson-East Coast line.

&gt; Prices start from $188,000 for a three-room and $303,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 45 months - 3.75 years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the first quarter of 2027.

&gt; In Choa Chu Kang, 987 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room, five-room are on offer at Keat Hong Grange, on a site near to ITE College West.

&gt; Prices start from $277,000 for a four-room and $390,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 43 months - 3.5 years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026.

&gt; In Jurong East, 562 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats are on offer at Jurong East Breeze, on a site along Jurong East Centre, next to the Pan-Island Expressway.

&gt; Prices start from $194,000 for a three-room and $283,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait about 60 months - five years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2028.

&gt; Flat applications close on Sept 5 at 11.59pm on the HDB flat portal. The flats will be allocated through balloting.

&gt; In November, about 9,500 BTO flats will be offered in towns such as Bukit Batok, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Tengah and Yishun.

&gt; HDB said it is on track to launch up to 23,000 new flats this year.

&gt; Next February, about 2,900 to 3,900 BTO flats will be offered on Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown and Tengah.

&gt; SINGAPORE - First-timer applicants will now stand a better chance at securing a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in non-mature estates, starting with the upcoming sales launch next Tuesday (Aug 30).

&gt; At least 95 per cent of the four-room and larger BTO flats in these estates will be set aside for first-timer families, up from 85 per cent, said the Ministry of National Development and the Housing Board on Saturday (Aug 27).

&gt; The allocation quota for first-timer families for three-room flat supply in non-mature will also increase to at least 85 per cent, up from 70 per cent.

&gt; There is no change to the allocation quota for BTO flat supply in mature estates. Currently, at least 95 per cent of flats in mature estates are set aside for first-timer families.

&gt; Up to 65 per cent of the non-senior two-room flexi flats in non-mature estates will be set aside for first-timer singles, up from 50 per cent.

&gt; The adjustments to the allocation quotas is to give first-timer applicants ""greater certainty"" in securing their first homes, as this group form the bulk of BTO applications, said MND and HDB.

&gt; Next Tuesday, HDB will offer about 4,900 flats in seven BTO projects across six estates, including in the non-mature estates of Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East and Woodlands.

&gt; The rest are from the mature estates of Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah and Tampines.

&gt; Another 9,500 BTO flats in towns such as Bukit Batok, Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown, and Yishun will be offered in November.

&gt; HDB said it is on track to launch up to 23,000 new flats this year and is prepared to launch up to 100,000 new flats between 2021 and 2025, if demands call for it.

So, the HDB flat is still allocated to the ""right"" people who are more serious about getting a flat and those who want the flat the most.

Why would you pay half a million for a dumpster unit while still having to wait out that 4-7 years when there could be subjectively better units in the SBF and open booking pool which allows you to wait less? 

BTO applicants are those who are able and willing to wait out the 4-7 years construction period, so if you get a shit ass number from balloting and are left with these undesirable units, most are likely to reject the remaining units and just wait for 3 months or a year later for a chance of scoring better numbers. 

These leftover units gets moved over to the SBF and OB pool anyway so people who are desperate for flats are able to and will buy them.

The trouble is HDB keep getting people to form new queues after each unsuccessful application.

Imagine if this happens in the bus interchange. You might end up waiting the whole day for your bus because you just keep failing to get into the front 40pax (or whatever capacity of each bus) of the list.

They should just keep a rolling application list for each area. Those who did not get selected for BTO should just get into the front queue for SBF. And the remainder of the SBF exercise should just rollover to subsequent open booking or SBF for the same area.

Case in point, I applied for 2-rm SBF last Nov, applied for 2-rm BTO in the same area in Feb in case it failed. Nov SBF results out only in late Feb that I did not make it. In May, new openings got listed for SBF. Again, applied for SBF, new queue!!

Awaiting results.

This double counting creates artificial demand when the actual unique applicant may be somewhat lower.

- Show us the breakdown of this 40% by ballot no. allocated. I'm sure those within the first 80% of flat supplies DID NOT have such high rejection rates.

- You got a lower rate by including 3 rooms inside. But for those wanting to starta  family, is 3-room sufficient? Not to mention, if you factor in the waiting time and MOP...3-room is really not ideal. And then the government wonders why our birth rates are declining... I mean, just look.

&gt; SINGAPORE - About 40 per cent of applicants who have been invited to book a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat end up declining the offer.

&gt; This is despite robust housing demand in the past two years, with some of the most popular BTO projects so popular that up to 16 applicants vie for each of the four-room flats available.

&gt; The Housing Board, in a statement on Sunday, said applicants who are invited to book a flat should take up the offer.

&gt; For those who turn down a chance to book a flat in the BTO or Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise, any additional ballot chances accumulated from previous unsuccessful applications will be set to zero.

&gt; HDB also said four in 10 BTO projects in 2020 and 2021 had application rates of 1.7 or lower, meaning that each unit only has 1.7 applicants or fewer vying for it.

&gt; The flats range from three to five-room units and are located in both mature and non-mature estates.

&gt; HDB said: ""With these application rates, the first-timers who applied for these flats stood a good chance of being invited to book a flat.""

&gt; There were about 19 BTO projects that had flats with first-timer application rates of 1.7 or lower, said HDB.

&gt; For seven of these 19 projects, the flats came with a shorter waiting time of less than three years.

&gt; HDB said: ""The waiting times for BTO projects launched in 2021 and 2020 have generally ranged from three to five years.

&gt; ""In fact, the median waiting time of BTO projects launched in 2021 was 3.8 years, which is lower than the 4.5 years for those launched in 2020.""

&gt; The locations for these BTO projects included areas in Bukit Batok, Jurong West and Tengah for non-mature estates and in Tampines for mature estates.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A total of 4,583 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats were launched for sale by the Housing Board on Friday (May 27), including two projects in Bukit Merah and Queenstown under the prime location public housing (PLH) model which comes with a 6 per cent subsidy clawback clause upon their resale.

&gt; The units are spread across five housing projects in five estates, in the second sales exercise for the year.

&gt; In addition, another 1,952 flats were on offer in this year's first Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) scheme.

&gt; In total, 6,535 new flats were launched on Friday.

&gt; Both the Bukit Merah and Queenstown BTO projects under the PLH model come with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; In the mature estate of Bukit Merah, Bukit Merah Ridge offers 1,669 three-room and four-room flats across five blocks, ranging from 29 to 48 storeys.

&gt; The project is bounded by Henderson, Tiong Bahru and Lower Delta roads. Future residents will be served by both Redhill and Tiong Bahru MRT stations.

&gt; Prices range from $377,000 to $509,000, without grants, for a three-room flat, and $540,000 to $737,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Prices are slightly lower than those in last November's Rochor BTO project, which is also under the PLH model. Prices start from $409,000 for a three-room flat and $582,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers of the Bukit Merah flats will have to wait about 60 months - around five years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the first quarter of 2028.

&gt; In the mature estate of Queenstown, a total of 867 three-room and four-room flats across four blocks are on offer at Ghim Moh Ascent.

&gt; The site sits along Ghim Moh Road, next to Buona Vista MRT station.

&gt; SINGAPORE: About 4,500 flats and two new projects under the Prime Location Public Housing (PLH) model will be launched in the May 2022 Build-to-Order (BTO) exercise.

&gt; The units will be in five towns - Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Queenstown, Toa Payoh and Yishun - said National Development Minister Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Monday (May 23).

&gt; Mr Lee added that one of the Housing and Development Board’s (HDB) Bukit Merah projects will be launched in August instead of May as “more time is needed to review the project and to better spread out the location of projects in mature and non-mature estates at each launch”.

&gt; “Overall, HDB is on track to launch up to 23,000 new flats this year,” he said.

&gt; A “sizeable” number of units in the May BTO exercise will be in mature estates to meet the “strong demand for flats”, Mr Lee added.

&gt; “They will better cater for young families who wish to live near their parents already staying in existing mature estates, for better mutual care and support,” he said.

&gt; Mr Lee also said that the application rates for projects in mature estates are expected to remain high.

&gt; Flat buyers are encouraged to consider applying for BTO flats located in non-mature estates such as Jurong West and Yishun where the application rates are “generally lower” compared to mature estates, he added.

&gt; The BTO launch will also see a concurrent Sale of Balance Flats exercise, which will offer units across various towns and estates islandwide.

&gt; “These flats are already under construction; some have even been completed. So, buyers can look forward to getting their flats earlier,” Mr Lee said.

&gt; SINGAPORE: About 6,000 Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats will be built on the site of Keppel Club, with the first Build-to-Order (BTO) project expected to launch within three years, said Minister for National Development Desmond Lee on Tuesday (Apr 12).

&gt; It was previously announced at the 2019 National Day Rally that about 9,000 new public and private homes will be built on the Keppel Club site.

&gt; Measuring around 48 hectares – about the size of 86 football fields, the area will be redeveloped for housing when the golf club’s lease “runs out”, said the National Development Minister.

&gt; “Being close to the coast as well as green spaces, the Keppel Club site will offer unique waterfront living, close to nature,” Mr Lee added.

&gt; The lease of Keppel Club expired on Dec 31, 2021, said the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) in response to queries.

&gt; To facilitate its transition to the Sime public course, Keppel was granted a six-month extension for the existing golf course site at Bukit Chermin Road until Jun 30, and a 9.5-month extension for its existing clubhouse and access until Oct 14.

&gt; ""In addition, a further 5.5-month extension till Mar 31, 2023 will be granted to facilitate Keppel's clearance and reinstatement of this site,"" said SLA in its statement.

&gt; With its central location and the two MRT stations nearby - Labrador Park MRT and Telok Blangah MRT - the ministry will “seek to keep the estate car-lite”, and enable residents to get around easily by walking or cycling.

&gt; “The housing estate will have new parks and open spaces which feature walking trails that connect to the MRT stations. This will provide residents with easy access to transport nodes and new social and commercial facilities,” said Mr Lee.

&gt; The housing developments will feature “skyrise greenery” and “landscaped terraces” to allow residents to “live in an eco-friendly environment”, he added.

&gt; “As the site is quite close to the city centre, we will bring homes closer to jobs. This is part of our effort to move towards having more housing options and mixed-use development in our central region.”

&gt; The Government also plans to transform the nearby Pasir Panjang Power Station buildings into a “distinctive and vibrant mixed-use district characterised by its unique industrial heritage and waterfront”, said Mr Lee.

1. Homeowners (HDB)
2. Non-homeowners (Want to BTO)

Homeowners DO NOT want BTO waiting times to be shortened. They want their property prices to increase, and the BTOs having retarded waiting times help push the resale prices up. A lot of people want to upgrade from their HDBs to private properties and a BTO shortage will benefit them. Many others want their home prices to increase so they can retire by downsizing or renting rooms out in the future.

1bc3757c0390b78fce6ba0b3b13c29d7,"&gt; # HDB monitoring supply chain situation; BTO delays remain in the range of 6 to 12 months

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Housing and Development Board (HDB) said that it will continue to monitor the supply chain situation amid “ongoing global geopolitical uncertainties” and the COVID-19 developments in China, as the range of delays for most Build-to-Order (BTO) projects remains between six to 12 months.

&gt; On Monday (Apr 11), The Straits Times reported that flat buyers in at least three BTO projects were informed of further delays to the completion of their homes.

&gt; Buyers at Tampines GreenCourt, Clementi NorthArc and Woodleigh Hillside BTO projects who were expecting their flats to be ready in the third quarter of this year now have to wait between three and six months more.

&gt; In response to CNA’s queries, HDB said that the construction sector is hard-hit by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, although it has been able to “catch up on some projects” by working closely with contractors and providing support measures to mitigate the extent of delays.

&gt; ""However, the extent of delay varies by project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, on-site technical challenges, the contractor’s performance and available supply of materials,"" said HDB.

&gt; ""The ongoing global geo-political uncertainties and worsening COVID-19 situation in China also add further uncertainties to the supply chain situation, and we continue to monitor these developments very closely.""

&gt; It added that delays have “largely remained” in the range of six to 12 months, except for projects with exceptional circumstances such as Waterway Sunrise II in Punggol.

&gt; For ongoing projects, HDB said it expects most flat buyers to be able to move into their new homes within four to five years after booking their flats, barring any unforeseen circumstances.

&gt; “The current median waiting times of projects launched in 2020 and 2021, after factoring in delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, are about 4.5 years and 3.8 years respectively,” said HDB.

&gt;SINGAPORE - Flat buyers in at least three Build-to-Order (BTO) projects have been informed by the Housing Board of further delays to their homes just months before they were due to be completed.  
&gt;  
&gt;Buyers at Tampines GreenCourt, Clementi NorthArc and Woodleigh Hillside BTO projects who were expecting their flats to be ready in the third quarter of this year - already a delayed completion date - will now have to wait between three and six more months for their homes.  
&gt;  
&gt;More than 25 buyers across the three projects told The Straits Times that they were frustrated at being informed so late about the latest round of delays.  
&gt;  
&gt;They will get the keys to their new homes nine to 12 months later than they had anticipated when they booked their flats.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the meantime, some are scrambling to make new plans.  
&gt;  
&gt;Assistant finance manager Joelle Lo, 37, said she was shocked to learn of the additional six-month wait for her four-room BTO flat in Woodleigh Hillside in Bidadari Park Drive. It will now be completed in the first quarter of 2023 instead of the third quarter of this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Ms Lo had hoped to complete renovation works and move into her new home by the end of this year, so that she could walk her six-year-old son to the nearby Maris Stella High School when he starts Primary 1 next year.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We had everything all planned out, but because of this last-minute notice, we will likely move in only around mid-2023 after doing renovation works,"" said Ms Lo, who also has a 15-month-old daughter.  
&gt;  
&gt;Until then, her husband will have to drive their son to school from their current home in Hougang.  
&gt;  
&gt;But they worry there may be more to come. ""Who knows if there will be further delays?"" she added.  
&gt;  
&gt;Tampines GreenCourt is slated to have 2,192 BTO units, Clementi NorthArc 1,179, and Woodleigh Hillside 1,355 units.  
&gt;  
&gt;The majority of buyers ST spoke to received e-mails from HDB on March 31 informing them about the latest delays.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the e-mail seen by ST, HDB said the disruptions in construction activities posed by 2020's two-month circuit breaker had been further exacerbated by Malaysia's closure of its border over the past two years, which impacted key construction supplies, and the tightening of border controls for workers from South Asia for several months in 2021.  
&gt;  
&gt;HDB said it has since implemented various measures to expedite on-site construction work and assist contractors to avoid further delays to the projects.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, despite the best efforts put in by HDB and our project partners, our latest assessment with less than a year to go to the current completion date of the project, is that there will unfortunately be a further delay to the project,"" said HDB in the e-mail to buyers.  
&gt;  
&gt;HDB assured buyers that it will continue to find ways to expedite construction work as much as possible, without compromising on the quality of the projects and the safety and well-being of workers.  
&gt;  
&gt;These include the sharing of Covid-19-related cost increases to assist contractors and permitting less noisy work to be carried out on Sundays and public holidays.  
&gt;  
&gt;But it also warned that there are still uncertainties with the global Covid-19 situation and ""further changes to the project timelines cannot be totally ruled out at this stage"".  
&gt;  
&gt;Buyers in at least two other BTO projects - Rivervale Shores in Sengkang and Eunos Court in Geylang - have also received similar e-mails from HDB to inform them of further three to six-month delays to their flats.  
&gt;  
&gt;Both projects were initially due to be completed in 2023.  
&gt;  
&gt;In response to queries from ST, HDB said affected buyers are updated periodically on project timelines and revised completion dates of their new flats, based on HDB's latest estimates.  
&gt;  
&gt;""For the first delay notification, this is usually done at the 18-month mark before the project's probable completion date, or earlier, to allow affected flat buyers time to source alternative interim housing,"" said HDB.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, as construction progresses, HDB said, it informs buyers of any further delays at periodic milestones.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These letters will be sent closer to the project's probable completion date and are usually the second delay notification,"" it added.  
&gt;  
&gt;HDB added that so far, it has not sent any third delay notices for BTO projects under construction.  
&gt;  
&gt;Even after the latest round, HDB said the range of delays for ongoing BTO projects has largely remained at between six and 12 months, in line with what National Development minister Desmond Lee told Parliament in November last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;Most flat buyers of ongoing projects will be able to move into their new homes within four to five years of booking their flats, barring any unforeseen circumstances, it added.  
&gt;  
&gt;HDB said it has been able to catch up on some BTO projects, but that the extent of delay varies by project, depending on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, on-site technical challenges, the contractor's performance and available supply of materials.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The ongoing global geopolitical uncertainties and worsening Covid-19 situation in China also add further uncertainties to the supply chain situation,"" said HDB.  
&gt;  
&gt;The current median waiting time, after factoring in Covid-19-related delays, is about 4.5 years for projects launched in 2020, and 3.8 years for those launched in 2021, added HDB.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time for standard BTO projects was three to four years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Finance manager Serene Toh, 36, whose first child is due next month, had hoped to move into her five-room BTO flat in Clementi NorthArc in Clementi Avenue 6 as soon as possible as she and her husband, who got married in 2016, have just a room now in his parents' home.  
&gt;  
&gt;But her flat has been delayed by three months, on top of the previous six months, and will be ready only in the fourth quarter of this year.  
&gt;  
&gt;""My husband and I are already finalising our interior design and had hoped for them to start work some time in the third quarter, so we're quite shocked HDB informed us of further delays at the very last stretch when we're just three months away,"" said Ms Toh.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Among all my friends, I was the first one to get married and the last one to get my home because most of them bought resale HDB flats or condominiums. I understand that some delays can't be helped because of the pandemic, but in hindsight, I would have gone for a resale HDB flat or condo too, although it does not make sense for me to do so now,"" she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;Public relations officer Niven Tham, 33, had signed a contract with a designer in 2020 to lock in a lower price up until October this year, based on the initial delayed timeline provided by HDB.  
&gt;  
&gt;But he is now looking at an additional 10 per cent to 15 per cent increase in renovation costs as the latest delays will push back the completion of his four-room BTO flat at Tampines GreenCourt in Tampines North Drive by three months.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mr Tham said he felt ""blindsided"" by ""the sudden announcement"".  
&gt;  
&gt;He will also have to extend his rental lease for at least three months. He and his girlfriend pay slightly more than $800 a month for a bedroom in a four-room HDB flat.  
&gt;  
&gt;Business owner Alivia Oh said she had some inkling that her estate was not on track to completion but was still shocked to receive news of an additional six-month delay to her four-room BTO flat in Clementi NorthArc.  
&gt;  
&gt;""I could tell that there were some sort of delays from the photos and videos updates sent by people on our BTO group chat. For example, some blocks were not yet fitted with windows and the roads and gardens were not done up,"" said Ms Oh, who is in her 30s.  
&gt;  
&gt;""But no news from HDB is good news, so we just assumed it was on track and we made our plans accordingly,"" she said.  
&gt;  
&gt;However, her suspicions were confirmed the night she received HDB's e-mail informing her of the delays.  
&gt;  
&gt;She said: ""The e-mail came at 10pm, so safe to say, it was a sleepless night.""",2022-04-11 00:31:19 UTC

HDB should adopt a hybrid scheme till we are ready to get rid of resale scheme altogether. **Build affordable public housing for Singaporeans who lease it purely for housing, not for investment.** If such lease tenants want to ""sell"" their HDB flats, they must sell it back to HDB with pro-rated depreciation.

cdd1704d4dfa3cfebaa9dfc0220d81e7,"&gt; # HDB launches second BTO project under prime location model in Kallang/Whampoa

&gt; SINGAPORE - A total of 3,953 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats were launched for sale by the Housing Board on Thursday (Feb 17), including 398 units in Kallang/Whampoa - the second project under the prime location public housing (PLH) model - which comes with a 6 per cent subsidy clawback clause upon their resale.

&gt; The units are spread across six housing projects in four estates, in the first sales exercise of the year.

&gt; King George's Heights in Kallang/Whampoa is the second BTO project to come under the PLH model, which comes with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; The project comprises three-room and four-room flats housed in one block with two wings of 33 and 47 storeys. Bounded by King George's Avenue, Syed Alwi Road, and Rochor Canal, the site is within a six-minute walk to the first PLH project in Rochor launched in November last year.

&gt; Prices start from $353,000, without grants, for a three-room flat and $488,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait an estimated 59 months - just under five years - for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2027.

&gt; Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time for a standard BTO flat was about three to four years.

&gt; Under the PLH model, owners of these Kallang/Whampoa flats will pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they sell their home on the open market for the first time.

&gt; The subsidy clawback applies to only the first resale transaction and does not apply to subsequent resales.

&gt; This also means that owners who choose not to sell their flats will not get their subsidies clawed back.

&gt; This is because HDB has to provide additional subsidies on top of those provided for all BTO flats in order to launch these prime area flats at affordable prices.

&gt; All subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as BTO flats.

&gt; Owners will also be subject to a 10-year minimum occupation period, up from the five years for other flats, before they can sell their flats on the open market.

&gt; Standard BTO flats come with a five-year MOP and do not have a subsidy clawback clause.

&gt; The other mature estate BTO project is Dakota Crest in Geylang, with 443 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats on offer across three blocks.

&gt; The project is located along Geylang River and the Geylang Park Connector, and is served by both Mountbatten MRT station and Dakota MRT station.

&gt; Prices start from $352,000 for a three-room flat and $522,000 for a four-room flat, making them the most expensive units in a mature estate in this launch.

&gt; This comes on top of the 63 months - slightly over five years - estimated waiting time for these units, as the project is estimated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2027.

&gt; There are two BTO projects in the non-mature estate of Yishun.

&gt; The bigger project is Grove Spring @ Yishun, where 987 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units are on offer across eight blocks on a site bounded by Yishun Avenue 6 and Yishun Avenue 8.

&gt; Prices start from $180,000 for a three-room unit, $270,000 for a four-room unit and $385,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; Buyers will also have the shortest wait for these flats at 26 months - just over two years - as the project is slated for completion in the fourth quarter of 2024.

&gt; The smaller adjacent project is Yishun Boardwalk, where 852 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units are spread across eight blocks.

&gt; Prices start from $189,000 for a three-room unit, $276,000 for a four-room unit and $410,000 for a five-room flat, making them the most affordable in this sale exercise.

&gt; The waiting time is also the shortest in this launch at about 30 months - or 2½ years - as these flats are slated for completion in the second quarter of 2025.

&gt; Buyers can also choose from two BTO projects in the ""forest town"" of Tengah.

&gt; The bigger project is Plantation Creek in the Plantation district, where 713 four-room and five-room units are on offer on a site next to the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE).

&gt; Prices start from $309,000 for a four-room flat and $420,000 for a five-room flat and these flats are slated for completion in 44 months - around 3½ years - in the second quarter of 2026.

&gt; The smaller project is Parc Flora @ Tengah, where 560 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units are on offer in the Park district where the car-free town centre is located.

&gt; Prices start from $231,000 for a three-room flat, $322,000 for a four-room flat and $428,000 for a five-room unit.

&gt; Buyers will have to wait 36 months - or three years - for these flats as the project is slated for completion in the second quarter of 2025.

&gt; Applications for the flats close next Wednesday (Feb 23) at 11.59pm on the HDB flat portal (https://homes.hdb.gov.sg/home/landing). The flats will be allocated through balloting.

&gt; In May, about 5,300 flats will be offered in towns such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Ghim Moh estate in Queenstown, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Yishun.

&gt; Another 6,300 to 6,800 flats in towns such as Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Choa Chu Kang, Jurong East, Queenstown and Woodlands will be offered in August.

&gt; The exact location of these projects and the number of flats at each site will be released closer to the launch date.

&gt; This represents a 35 per cent increase every year in the number of flats available, from the 17,000 flats launched this year, said HDB.

&gt; Next year, home buyers can tap on BTO flats across mature and non-mature towns such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown, Tengah, Toa Payoh and Yishun.

&gt; National Development Minister Desmond Lee said at a press conference that HDB will be prepared to launch up to 100,000 flats from 2021 to 2025, and will calibrate supply based on prevailing demand.

&gt; Mr Lee noted that BTO application rates have increased from 3.7 applications per BTO flat in 2019 to 5.5 in 2021, despite more flats being offered by the HDB.

&gt; HDB launched around 14,600 units in 2019 and around 17,000 units per year in 2020 and 2021.

&gt; The strong demand was driven by newly-married couples and a growing trend of people choosing to live in smaller households, noted Mr Lee.

&gt; A buoyant resale market amid the Covid-19 pandemic also channelled more demand to the BTO market, said HBD.

&gt; The HDB added: ""The increased supply of flats will provide more housing options for young couples planning to start their marriage and parenthood journey, as well as for second-timer families, multi-generation families, the elderly, and singles.""

&gt; Supply of private housing though the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme will also be increased, said Mr Lee.

&gt; For the first half of 2022, there will be around 2,800 units on the Confirmed List, a 40 per cent increase from the previous GLS programme in the second half of 2021.

&gt; Another 3,700 units are on the Reserve List for the first half of 2022.

&gt; Mr Lee said the Government is prepared to step up supply even further if demand remains strong.

&gt; The increased supply in public and private housing comes on the back of a new set of cooling measures announced on Wednesday (Dec 15) aimed at promoting a stable and sustainable housing market, given the increasing risk of property prices running ahead of market fundamentals and impacting housing affordability.

&gt; From Thursday, additional buyer's stamp duty (ABSD) that must be paid for purchases of additional properties will be raised.

&gt; The total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) for borrowers will also be tightened, while Housing Board loans will be lowered from 90 per cent to 85 per cent of a property's purchase price.

74b67a4cb0f23e7c1ca5cb47d1483295,"it's really depressing how poorly they are able to project housing demand. 


this is not even unique to HDB - it's endemic to everything. Their policy is always reactionary instead of forward looking. After a whole decade of MND bitching that HDB supply is more than sufficient, FINALLY we are seeing something concrete being done (too many years spent on ""but in the 1990s we built and built and nobody wanted to buy!"" spiel).


I don't even want to go and rehash how reactionary we've been throughout the pandemic and the ""opening up"" measures we've taken to date. As the most recent example - what do you mean you want to ""ramp up healthcare capabilities in light of Omicron""? Shouldn't it be already ramped up to 120% due to the huge surge in cases we've had in the last 3 months? Now the G wants to ""ramp up""? Is this on the scale of the last ""ramp up"" they've been meaning to do since May 2020, that led us to having less than 300 ICU beds when the huge spike happened a few months ago?


and we want to go back to status quo of having metric tons of construction projects and throwing cheap labour at them instead of looking at how to moving towards a skilled construction workforce and paying them appropriately. while the pandemic continues to reappear again and again because surprise surprise, their living conditions continue to be conducive towards spreading the disease if someone gets infected. i'm expecting the pikachu face again when the BTOs are inevitably delayed when the dorms get another round of infections and everything gets dragged another few years.

Also, they would be reviewing your eligibility for the housing grant which means your income also shouldn't be understated for that. Hence, the easiest way for them is to get an accountant to do a simple audit &amp; also help verify the payslips for the past few months (i.e. last i applied, they wanted past 3 months income i think). 

It helps if you use a simple accounting software to log these really. 

Perhaps you can look into doing a simple audit yearly by an accountant. They also help you figure out your tax so that you don't miss anything.

There are alot of outsourced accounting services or you can just ask around for anything you know that is an accountant. It is quite common and not expensive.

6% only but better than nothing I guess. Additional 5 years MOP only delays the housing bubble imo but it's still gonna happen. Also, why only applied to first resale but not subsequent resales? HDB should be be doing more, both in the profit clawback percentage and in the resale of HDB. 

Let's do some quick math about the 6%. Assuming you buy the new PLH BTO at $600,000 and sell it at $800,000, you would have made a total of $200,000. After factoring in the 6% clawing back by HDB ($48,000), you would still have $152,000 profit.

57d1ccaa506dfde8a3c98f34324083f5,"&gt; # HDB launches over 4,501 BTO flats; first prime location project in Rochor comes with 6% subsidy clawback

&gt; SINGAPORE - A total of 4,501 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats were launched for sale by the Housing Board on Wednesday (Nov 17), including 960 units in Rochor - the first project under a new prime location public housing (PLH) model - which comes with a 6 per cent subsidy clawback clause upon their resale.

&gt; The units are spread across nine housing projects in six estates, with a median waiting time of 4.4 years for flats to be completed.

&gt; In addition, another 1,798 flats were on offer in this year's second, and final, Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) sales.

&gt; In total, 6,299 new flats were launched on Wednesday.

&gt; The highly anticipated PLH project - River Peaks I and II in Rochor - comes with stricter buying and selling conditions.

&gt; A total of 960 three-room and four-room flats are on offer across six 47-storey blocks. Another 40 two-room rental flats will be integrated in one of the blocks.

&gt; The project sits on two plots of land along Weld Road and Kelantan Road and is directly connected to Jalan Besar MRT station.

&gt; Prices start from $409,000, without grants, for a three-room flat and $582,000 for a four-room flat, making them the most expensive units in a mature estate in this launch.

&gt; The prices are slightly higher than those in August's Queenstown BTO project, Queen's Arc, where a three-room flat started from $382,000 and a four-room flat began from $540,000.

&gt; Under the PLH model, owners of these Rochor flats will pay 6 per cent of the resale price or valuation, whichever is higher, to HDB when they resell their home on the open market for the first time.

&gt; The subsidy clawback only applies to the first resale transaction and does not apply to subsequent resales.

&gt; This is because HDB has to provide additional subsidies on top of those provided for all BTO flats in order to launch these prime areas flats at affordable prices.

&gt; All subsidies are factored into flat prices when they are launched as BTO flats.

&gt; In order to prevent excessive windfall gains when owners sell their flats on the open market, HDB said it will claw back the additional subsidies.

&gt; This also means that owners who choose to not sell their flats will not get their subsidies clawed back.

&gt; Owners will also be subject to a 10-year minimum occupation period (MOP), up from the current five years, before they can sell it on the open market.

&gt; This comes on top of the 71 months - just under six years- waiting time for these flats, as the project is estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2028.

&gt; Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time for a standard BTO flat was about three to four years.

&gt; This means owners will likely only be able to resell these flats sometime in 2038.

&gt; The pool of resale buyers of these Rochor flats will also be limited to households who earn not more than $14,000 a month, with at least one applicant a Singapore citizen.

&gt; The PLH model - to ensure that new public housing in prime, central locations will remain affordable, accessible and inclusive for Singaporeans - comes after almost a year of public consultations.

&gt; At least one prime location housing project will be launched each year, although proportion of flats will differ year on year to ensure a diverse supply across estates.

&gt; Seniors can have their pick in this sales exercise, with 68 two-room flexi flats on offer in a second ""vertical kampung"" in the non-mature estate of Choa Chu Kang.

&gt; The Heart of Yew Tee is an integrated development and houses Chua Chu Kang's first hawker centre, a polyclinic, a community club, a kidney dialysis centre, a community plaza and retail shops.

&gt; Flats will come with elderly-friendly fittings and smart distribution boards.

&gt; Prices start from $72,000 and only seniors aged 55 and above can apply for these flats.

&gt; The project sits adjacent to YewTee Point shopping mall, which has a sheltered linkway to Yew Tee MRT Station.

&gt; The estimated completion date is in the first quarter of 2026, so buyers have to wait about four years for their homes.

&gt; It is Singapore's third integrated development with housing for seniors, after Kampung Admiralty in Woodlands and the community care apartments, a type of assisted living public housing, in Harmony Village @ Bukit Batok.

&gt; In the current November launch, the only other BTO project in a mature estate is Kent Heights in Kallang/Whampoa.

&gt; A total of 430 two-room flexi and four-room flats are on offer, on a site along Owen Road, next to the Central Expressway (CTE).

&gt; Prices start from $192,000 for a two-room flexi flat and $511,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; The estimated completion date is in the fourth quarter of 2026, which means buyers will have to wait more than four years for them to be ready.

&gt; There are two BTO projects in the non-mature estate of Hougang.

&gt; The bigger project is Hougang Olive, where 390 four-room and five-room flats are on offer on a site by Hougang Avenue 3, Hougang Street 12, and Hougang Street 13.

&gt; Prices start from $308,000 for a four-room flat and $416,000 for a five-room unit.

&gt; The waiting time is just under three years, as these flats are slated for completion in the first quarter of 2025, making these one of the fastest projects to be ready in this launch.

&gt; The smaller project, which sits on an adjacent site, is Tanjong Tree Residences @ Hougang, where 300 four-room and five-room units are on offer.

&gt; Prices start from $318,000 for a four-room flat and $419,000 for a five-room unit.

&gt; These flats are estimated to be ready in just under four years, in the second quarter of 2026.

&gt; In the non-mature estate of Jurong West, 221 three-room and four-room flats are on offer at Nanyang Opal, on a site bounded by Jurong West Street 92 and 93.

&gt; Prices start from $173,000 for a three-room flat and $264,000 for a four-room flat, making them the most affordable in this sales exercise.

&gt; These flats are estimated to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025, so buyers have to wait around 3.5 years for them.

&gt; Tengah, Singapore's newest town, has two BTO projects in the Park district.

&gt; The bigger project is Parc Clover @ Tengah, where 1,124 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room flats are on offer.

&gt; Prices start from $119,000 for a two-room flexi, $312,000 for a four-room and $428,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; The smaller project is Parc Glen @ Tengah , where X1,008 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room flats are on offer.

&gt; Prices start from $120,000 for a two-room flexi, $319,000 for a four-room and $436,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt; Flats in both Tengah projects are slated for completion in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a waiting time of around 2.5 years, making them among the fastest to be completed in this launch.

&gt; The 1,798 units offered under the SBF scheme are spread across mature and non-mature estates such as Bishan, Bukit Merah, Clementi, Queenstown and Punggol.

&gt; About 31 per cent of them are already completed, while the rest are in various stages of construction.

&gt; These flats are expected to be popular among buyers as the completion date of BTO projects have been stretched longer due to the manpower shortage and supply disruption in the construction industry arising from the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; Applications for the flats close next Tuesday (Nov 23) at 11.59pm on the HDB flat portal. The flats will be allocated through balloting.

&gt; Next February, about 3,900 flats will be offered in towns such as Geylang, Kallang/Whampoa, Tengah and Yishun.

&gt; Another 5,200 to 5,700 flats will be offered in towns such as Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Queenstown, Tampines, Toa Payoh and Yishun in May next year.

&gt; The exact location of these projects and the number of flats at each site will be released only three months ahead of the launch.

Having said that, I disagree with having landed property gone. If everyone is forced to live in ""shoeboxes"", IMO it will make Singapore feel way more cramped and claustrophobic than it already is. The diversity and historical significance of the shop houses, black and whites, and some landed properties are unique/ add character. With Singapore already being culturally ""poor"" and ""boring""; it will just exacerbate this. Look at the ""Peranakan inspired"" condos, they just use a few generic ethnic inspired tiles that are being sold worldwide and market it as ""Peranakan"". I think we need to have architectural diversity and encourage it. 

What I would rather see less of : ugly office buildings and malls. Now with WFH/ remote work becoming a thing, do we really need so many office buildings? Also, how many Uniqlos do we really need? I think it would be amazing if we could bring back shophouses to its roots. Commerical first floor, residential above. Just my two cents :)

HDB towns could use less cars roads and more car separated infrastructure like what it is seen in MyWaterway @ Punggol. Really ironic to say people should go car lite and yet there are still 4 lane roads in a lot of places.

HDB as the biggest developer in Singapore has a lot of influence over flat sizes. If HDB builds bigger flats, private property developers will build bigger homes. 

There are minimum apartment sizes in Singapore but I don’t think minimum apartment sizes are a good idea as they increase the minimum price of an apartment. Homes are small because the land cost per square feet is high, and people do consider the overall cost of the apartment when buying a home. I’ve seen some 380 square feet apartments in Spottiswoode Park and they can act as starter apartments for singles and young couples. If these apartments are small, there are even smaller studio apartments in Japan and Hong Kong.

But let me come to you with a different perspective.  A different philosophy and view of how the housing market would be from that of the younger generation.    You see, even if you were to sit down with a young Singaporean in his early 20s and mathematically calculate how financially feasible renting is, the Millennial might simply still not accept this option because he simply will not get to own the house after 10 years.  That is to say, **the ownership component ranks incredibly high in the priority of a young Singaporean’s life**.  

Now, you might think that this is an entirely self imposed problem and maybe people should not have high expectations then.  But then I raise to you that isn’t this what we have been doing for healthcare all this time? Why can’t we treat housing as a universal right just like education and healthcare?  So, your conclusion at the end that housing should not be subsidised and your vague explanation of how it is ‘underutilised’ literally makes 0 sense to me.  Shouldn’t ownership % be a good metric of how well our housing policy is working ?

Also, the entire system of how BTO works is not only out of touch with our demographics, marriage rates and values among Singaporeans.  I would say we need to plan for smaller and cheaper flats for single and divorced people to stay in.   And even aside from that, the current way BTO works is not even aligned with family raising goals and values.  Like it does not even achieve the most basic of objectives even now, which is why Singaporeans are not having enough children and why we keep relying on foreigners.",2021-10-31 07:05:49 UTC

e960573d5e0b855ec56c65d5f493e2c8,"Edit: TLDR, agree desire to profit by existing home homeowners holds back increase in housing supply as that lowers prices and cost votes. Disagree that renting is the solution. Still prefer encouraging ownership of public housing but limit potential for upside so that they are not seen as investments to begin with and owners aren't pissed off when supply is increased.  


Agree with you on the part that HDBs shouldn't be seen as a tool to earn money. Where we diverge is you are suggesting to remove subsidies, implicitly making BTO more expensive and much closer to resale prices and encourage part of the population to rent instead since BTO windfall is reduced as both BTO and resale are expensive.

My preferred solution is instead to limit resale prices by forcing flats to be sold back to HDB so that resale prices are at BTO plus wage growth/inflation. Buy cheap but can only sell cheap. I prefer this instead of your proposal as there are non financial benefits to home ownership which you also acknowledged such as not being subject to the whims of the rental market,  the renovation and what not you can do to your place etc. 

This may drive up demand for resale if they become more affordable but more flats can be built. I believe the real obstacle to building more flats is not physical constraints but political appetite as more supply will drive down prices and cost votes. This will be less of an issue if people don't expect to earn much from BTOs/their HDBs to begin with per my suggestion. I suppose it serves the same purpose albeit through a different method to how you propose to tackle the same issue of political cost of decreasing property prices by reducing the number of owners with a stake in ever increasing property prices by having more renters.

Alas, both our proposals are unlikely to happen in the near future due to the existing stock of homeowners who will be negatively affected by a drop in housing prices. The best we can expect in the short term on housing affordability is for the Govt to intervene from time to time to temper property prices when people who are not homeowners are pissed off enough to worry the Govt.

&gt; While stripping back subsidies will be incredibly unpopular, it forces the government to use market mechanisms such as increasing supply in order to ensure homes remain affordable for all. Since the amount of housing that can be built is tied to the amount of subsidies, reducing subsidies will mean more housing can be built. 

I don't see subsidies for homeownership as the limiting factor behind supply shortages. The potential for profit and the associated political costs from limiting such profits by increasing supply is the real limiter

On having to reduce subsidies before Govt can afford to build more housing, I don't really agree. Land cost is an accounting thing, it's a paper cost between different govt ledgers so it's not as if the Govt will run out of money to build HDBs even if the paper loss reported by HDB increases. The money for the land is going to another Govt pocket, the SLA.

&gt; Reducing subsidies will reduce the gap between the cost of renting and the cost of a mortgage, which will reduces the incentive for people to buy and not rent. 

Even if you look at private property which are not subsidised, the cost of renting is not substantially lower than that of monthly mortgage, at least in the current interest rate environment. 

Also, you build equity in a house when paying mortgage (even if there's no increase in property prices) instead of expensing it off as rental.

Then there is still the liquidity issue - you can use CPF to pay your mortgage but not rental. You can't really do allow CPF to be expensed for rental either because rental is an expense and there is nothing to ""refund"" back to your CPF account for your retirement like when you sell a property.

What the current subsidy for BTO really helps with is by reducing the amount of downpayment needed.

All in all, don't see the calculation towards rental instead of ownership make sense financially if one can afford the downpayment. Don't think even with removal of subsidies for BTO, we will see people moving to rent unless rental is subsidised or unless they can't afford the unsubsidized BTOs.",2021-10-31 05:37:44 UTC
c1c9b6e310337c86967b95d877be7b55,"You seem to be very confused.

&gt; If the cost of housing continues to increase, people will be incentivised to buy a home and not rent.

No, it is the opposite. Increased cost of housing incentivizes people to rent, not buy a home. This is basic supply/demand economics. Do you have any reasons to support the idea that Singapore’s housing does not follow standard economic models?

&gt; Switzerland’s homeownership rate is half of that of the United Kingdom’s. However, housing prices in the UK has tripled since the 70s, while homes in Switzerland has increased by only 70%.

Seems to be the exact opposite of what you stated, that “countries with high homeownership rates have volatile housing prices.” If anything this correlated supports the opposite claim.

&gt; Reducing subsidies will mean more housing can be built.

That isn’t how it works at all. In a market economy subsidies increase the quantity of goods produced, not the other way around. Also Singapore’s HDB flats are not a market economy, the construction is centrally planned. They are sold at cost, the homebuyer pays the cost of construction minus what subsidies the government provides.",2021-10-31 04:40:57 UTC
c724de21647eeae896c7c4b2334715ea,"far too many Singaporeans brought the narrative wholeheartedly. As they approach retirement age, they are finding their retirement to be inadequate.

most of singaporeans are assets rich cash poor.

in recent years Lawrence Wong publicly drop a bomb shell, most land with tenure will be returned to the government at no cost once the lease ends.

now those assets has indeed been confirmed by PAP to be a depreciating asset.

to be fair to the PAP, it has been made known to home owner since day one when they purchase the flat. However this piece of info was squarely against the state narrative of asset appreciation at that point in time, therefore not being broadcasted. 

Apart from incentive, the issue of retirement adequacy must be considered as well since majority of home owners will see bulk of their cash being tied up in their property.

PAP simply cannot achieve 2 polarising goals at the same time. Wanting flats to be affordable to the masses and it being an appreciating assets at the same time.

f1d98c269c801157e299939c2ddefd78,"&gt; # Two-thirds of BTO projects completed during Covid-19 outbreak delayed by 6 months or less: HDB

&gt; SINGAPORE - Buyers of flats in 17 Build-To-Order (BTO) projects completed and delivered during the Covid-19 pandemic faced additional waiting time of six months or less, said the Housing Board on Tuesday (Oct 12).

&gt; The 17 projects make up about two-thirds of the 25 BTO projects delivered since January last year.

&gt; The remaining eight BTO projects were delayed by between seven and 10 months, said HDB.

&gt; In total, more than 16,000 new homes have been delivered to Singaporeans since January 2020.

&gt; Including pandemic-induced delays, the waiting time for the projects ranged from 2.4 years to 5.3 years, with an average waiting time of 4.1 years, said HDB.

&gt; Last Saturday, HDB said it is on track to complete another five more BTO projects by the end of this year, barring unforeseen circumstances.

&gt; This comes as National Development Minister Desmond Lee said in Parliament earlier this month that the average waiting time for ongoing BTO flats is between four and five years, even after taking into account delays brought about by the pandemic.

&gt; He was clarifying the misconception that waiting times for BTO flats have risen to six to seven years, given the impact that Covid-19 has had on the construction sector.

&gt; For newer BTO projects launched this year and last year, the estimated waiting times range between three and 5½ years.

&gt; While there are some projects that may take longer to complete, including Queen's Arc in Queenstown, which was launched in August, they are the outliers.

&gt; The 610-unit project in the mature estate of Queenstown has a waiting time of about 5½ years because of its difficult construction conditions and taller buildings.

&gt; One of the BTO projects completed and delivered to buyers during the pandemic was Bedok North Vale, which has 215 units across two blocks.

&gt; Construction began in May 2017 and the project was originally slated for completion in the third quarter of 2020.

&gt; All works were halted in April 2020 during the two-month-long circuit breaker.

&gt; The outstanding works then included painting of the common areas and landscaping works, as well as installation of fittings within the flats.

&gt; The project's main contractor, China Construction Realty Co, resumed works progressively after the circuit breaker measures were lifted in June and completed the project in December 2020, six months after its original estimated completion date. This brought total waiting time for Bedok North Vale to 3½ years.

&gt; As at Sept 30, 208 out of the 215 units at Bedok North Vale have been booked and more than 90 per cent of flat owners - or 194 - have collected their keys.

&gt; A number of key factors contributed to the quick resumption of construction works at Bedok North Vale following the lifting of circuit breaker measures, said HDB on Tuesday.

&gt; HDB worked with the contractor to build two temporary living quarters on-site to house workers, which helped reduce the risks of infection and the number of workers who needed to commute to the site daily.

&gt; Manpower was deployed to complete the works within the flats, such as painting of walls and installation of fittings, before moving on to works in the common spaces. This helped to speed up the completion of the flats by two months and buyers were able to get their keys earlier, said HDB.

&gt; HDB also gave advance payments to the contractor and co-shared the prolongation costs arising from the project delays, thus alleviating the contractor's non-manpower operating expenses.

&gt; The contractor also adhered to strict safe management measures on-site, which enabled it to resume works in just three days after one worker tested positive for Covid-19 during a routine swab test.

&gt; Virtual inspections were conducted, in additional to physical ones, and issues were rectified by the contractor before flats were handed over to their owners, said HDB.

&gt; On Tuesday, HDB said: ""All our building contractors have been affected by the pandemic, albeit to different degrees depending on their companies' resources and financial strength.""

&gt; HDB added that it has been checking in regularly with building contractors and consultants to address any problems early and render assistance where necessary.

&gt; It said: ""We have also been engaging some of the key sub-contractors and suppliers of our BTO projects to widen our sources of feedback and pick up emerging issues early.

&gt; ""We will monitor the situation closely, and stand ready to do more to help our contractors to complete their projects, so that flat buyers can collect their keys and move into their new homes with as little disruption as possible.""

&gt; SINGAPORE - Construction companies working on Housing Board projects have been thrown a lifeline to help lock in prices and supplies for some raw materials, in a move by the Government to ensure that construction progress remains on track and to minimise delays for home buyers.

&gt; Measures include extending the duration of steel price protection provided by HDB for a total of nine additional months so that contractors do not have to worry about the fluctuation in steel prices, said the Ministry of National Development (MND) in a written parliamentary reply on Monday (Sept 13).

&gt; HDB will also provide additional supplies of concrete materials to contractors for local pre-cast production, going beyond the amount that contractors had earlier opted for in their tender, said MND. This refers to cement, sand and other aggregates.

&gt; Previously, steel price protection provided for HDB was either for 18 or 22 months, typically covering the duration of structural works which are now taking longer to be completed due to the Covid-19 situation.

&gt; With the nine-month extension, a contractor who started structural works in January 2020 can now be protected against fluctuations in steel prices until March 2022.

&gt; The HDB said in a separate statement on Wednesday that about 35 projects could benefit from this extension.

&gt; Since January this year, the prices of steel and concreting materials have risen by about 25 per cent and 15 per cent respectively, it noted.

&gt; HDB has also received feedback from the Singapore Contractors Association that the quantities of steel ordered by contractors remain low due to the slower progress of construction works.

&gt; At the same time, in the light of Malaysia's movement control order (MCO), contractors here are relocating their precast production back to Singapore or switching to the cast-in-situ method of construction.

&gt; These contractors may have previously opted for a smaller quantity of concreting materials from HDB, given that their precasters were overseas, HDB noted. But they may now require more materials, which the HDB will provide them with and at the same price committed in the tender.

&gt; For contractors who wish to relocate some of their precast production back to Singapore, HDB will assist them in their application for land under a temporary occupation licence for the production and storage of the precast components.

&gt; Contractors will be able to apply for additional supplies from October 2021.

&gt; The move comes after the main contractors of five Build-To-Order (BTO) projects went bust last month, which caused around 2,900 buyers to face long delays for their homes.

&gt; The affected projects are Sky Vista @ Bukit Batok, Senja Heights and Senja Ridges in Bukit Panjang, Marsiling Grove in Woodlands and West Coast Parkview in Clementi.

&gt; The five projects are at various stages of completion, with the two Bukit Panjang projects near completion, said MND.

&gt; The main contractors, Greatearth Corporation and Greatearth Construction, along with three other related companies, are currently in the process of liquidation.

&gt; The construction industry has been one of the sectors worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic.

&gt; Construction costs have risen, with increased foreign manpower cost due to tightened border measures and increased raw materials costs. Companies have also racked up additional costs to adhere to safe management measures that are meant to curb the transmission of Covid-19.

&gt; On Monday, MND said HDB is working with Greatearth and their provisional liquidator PricewaterhouseCoopers to bring onboard new contractors to take over and complete the five BTO projects as soon as possible.

&gt; Discussions are ongoing for the potential new main contractors and existing subcontractors to work together.

&gt; ""This will allow affected subcontractors the opportunity to work out a suitable arrangement to remain on the projects and complete the remaining works. It will also minimise the extent of delays for flat buyers,"" said MND.

&gt; 

&gt; Just before mid-August, on the feedback from a project consultant, HDB had checked with Greatearth and was informed that they had run into financial difficulties and were exploring options to continue with the projects.

&gt; Slightly more than a week later, Greatearth informed HDB that they were unable to complete the five BTO projects, despite the government assistance provided to all construction firms over the past year.

&gt; Prior to this, work at the sites had been progressing satisfactorily, and there were no signs of work slow-down, said MND.

&gt; HDB had explored possible options to resolve Greatearth's challenges, such as providing advance payments to allow them to continue with the projects.

&gt; However, Greatearth did not have the financial ability to continue operations and made the decision to undergo liquidation, said MND.

&gt; Home buyers of the five affected BTO projects have not yet been informed of their revised completion date. HDB said buyers will be informed when the replacement contractors have been appointed and the construction schedule worked out.

&gt; In June last year, a $1.36 billion construction support package was announced to help construction companies co-fund some of the extra costs they have to incur to comply with safe management measures at the worksites.

&gt; Under the Covid-19 (Temporary Measures) Bill, construction companies can also get reprieve from legal and enforcement action for their building and supply contracts, although the relief period is set to end at the end of this month.

&gt; The flat-type with the highest demand were four-room units in Hougang - more than 11,400 people applied for just 459 of such flats. That means each applicant only has a 4 per cent chance of getting a unit.

&gt; With more than 18 first-time applicants per four-room flat in Hougang, this is one of the highest application rates seen in recent years.

&gt; One of the main draws for applicants for Kovan Wellspring is its location next to the MRT station, said Mr Lee Sze Teck, senior director of research at Huttons Asia.

&gt; The development in Kovan is also “highly popular”, with few new BTO flats in the area, said Ms Christine Sun, senior vice president of research and analytics at OrangeTee &amp; Tie.

&gt; For Hougang Citrine, it is close to Paya Lebar Methodist Girls’ School and Maris Stella High - both “popular among parents”, she added.

&gt; There was also huge demand for four-room flats at Toh Guan Grove in Jurong East, with 3,628 applicants for just 240 units. This means each applicant only has a 6.6 per cent chance of success.

&gt; There is “pent-up” demand in the Jurong East area as there have not been many BTO launches there, said Mr Lee and Ms Sun.

&gt; This is the first BTO project in Jurong East in 10 years, and it is within walking distance to a station on the future Jurong Region Line.

&gt; Both Hougang Citrine and Toh Guan Grove also have an average construction period of about four years.

&gt; “The shorter construction period is the draw and the cash over valuation in the resale market is the push,” said Mr Lee.

&gt; In total, there were more than 18,600 applications for three-room or bigger BTO flats in non-mature estates, despite there being only 1,064 units available. This equates to more than 17 applicants per unit.

&gt; MATURE ESTATES

&gt; With 2,883 three-room or larger flats available in mature estates, this was the highest number of such units being made available in a BTO exercise since November last year.

&gt; Set to be built in the areas of Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown and Tampines, they drew nearly 15,000 applicants. That equates to about five applicants per unit.

The downside is that if your parents lived in a “valuable” estate the property prices will be always quite out of reach.

There are schemes to benefit your application, you get BTO flats allocated to your group if you live near your parents. You get double the ballot chance if your previous ballot was unsuccessful too. I think these schemes helped me get a flat when my BTO was oversubscribed 5 to 1 (during the mah bow tan era somemore). Downside was that by the time I select the flat there wasn’t much units left (still happy with the flat though).

And honestly I feel you have agency in this. If the five year wait is too long, really consider rental. It can get your plans off the ground so you don’t feel like you’re just being held up by the govt.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A total of 4,989 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats across seven housing projects in five estates were launched for sale by the Housing Board (HDB) on Wednesday (Aug 11).

&gt; This was the third sales exercise for the year, with a median waiting time of just over four years for flats to be completed.

&gt; A highly anticipated BTO project is Queen's Arc in Queenstown - one of the most sought-after mature housing estates in Singapore's oldest town - where 610 three-room and four-room flats are on offer across two blocks.

&gt; The site is next to Alexandra Hospital and is bounded by Queen's Crescent and Queensway Drive.

&gt; This is the first time in nine years new flats are being launched in Queenstown.

&gt; The last BTO project launched there was the 1,179-unit Ghim Moh Edge project in November 2012, which sits next to the future housing land parcel that will be carved out from Dover Forest.

&gt; The prices then started from $310,000, without grants, for a three-room flat and $450,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; According to official HDB data, there have been at least seven units in Ghim Moh Edge that have changed hands for at least $1 million. The most recent inked deal was $1.07 million for a five-room unit in April this year.

&gt; In Queen's Arc, prices start from $382,000, without grants, for a three-room flat and $540,000 for a four-room flat, making them the most expensive units in a mature estate in this launch.

&gt; Buyers will also have to wait more than five years for these flats - the longest wait in this launch - as the project is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2027.

&gt; HDB said the long waiting time is mainly due to additional preparation works required for the site as well as the design of the project.

&gt; ""One of the residential blocks in the project, at 39 storeys high, is taller than most of the other BTO projects. Hence, a longer construction time is required,"" said HDB.

&gt; Before the Covid-19 pandemic, the waiting time for a standard BTO flat was about three to four years.

&gt; For the first time in 10 years, the non-mature estate of Jurong East will get its first new flats.

&gt; A total of 569 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats are on offer at Toh Guan Grove, which sits near the upcoming Toh Guan MRT station on the Jurong Region Line.

&gt; 

&gt; Prices start from $237,000 for a three-room flat and $347,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; The estimated completion date is in the first quarter of 2026, so buyers have to wait about four years for their homes.

&gt; The last BTO launch for Jurong East was Teban View in September 2011, where some 518 three- and four-room flats were released for sale.

&gt; Prices then started from $158,000 for a three-room flat and $271,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; In the current August launch, there are two BTO projects in the mature estate of Tampines.

&gt; The bigger project is Tampines GreenQuartz, where 1,613 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units are on offer on a site close to Tampines West MRT station on the Downtown Line.

&gt; Prices start from $244,000 for a three-room unit, $352,000 for a four-room unit and $485,000 for a five-room flat.

&gt;

&gt; 

&gt; These flats are estimated to be ready in more than four years, in the second quarter of 2026.

&gt; The smaller project is Tampines GreenJade, where 546 four- and five-room units are on offer, on a land parcel next to Bedok canal that overlooks Bedok Reservoir.

&gt; Prices start from $342,000 for a four-room flat and $475,000 for a five-room unit.

&gt; The waiting time is about 3.5 years, as these flats are slated for completion in the third quarter of 2025.

&gt; 

&gt; The smallest BTO project in this launch is Towner Residences in the mature estate of Kallang/Whampoa.

&gt; A total of 316 three- and four-room flats are on offer on a site along Towner Road, next to the Central Expressway.

&gt; The project includes a block of rental flats.

&gt; Prices start from $336,000 for a three-room flat and $500,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt; These flats are slated for completion in just under four years in the fourth quarter of 2026.

&gt;

&gt; 

&gt; There are two BTO projects available in the non-mature estate of Hougang.

&gt; The smaller project is Kovan Wellspring with 586 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room units on offer. It will be integrated with the new Paya Lebar Kovan Community Club.

&gt; It is located on a site next to Heartland Mall and Kovan MRT station on the North-East Line.

&gt; Prices start from $289,000 for a three-room flat and $413,000 for a four-room flat.

&gt;

&gt; 

&gt; Buyers have to wait about 4.5 years for these flats, which are estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2026.

&gt; The bigger project is Hougang Citrine, with 749 two-room flexi, three-room, four-room and five-room units along Hougang Avenue 3.

&gt; Prices start from $199,000 for a three-room flat, $324,000 for a four-room flat and $392,000 for a five-room unit, making them the most affordable in this sales exercise.

&gt; Buyers will also have the shortest wait for these flats - around three years - as the project is slated for completion in the first quarter of 2025.

&gt;

&gt; 

&gt; Applications for the flats close next Tuesday (Aug 17) at 11.59pm on the HDB flat portal. The flats will be allocated through balloting.

&gt; On Wednesday, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said in a Facebook post that many BTO projects have been delayed beyond their original estimated completion dates, as the construction sector has been hit hard by Covid-19 .

&gt; However, he assured home buyers that HDB is working with contractors and other agencies to reduce construction delays and will keep buyers updated on the completion date of their new flat as construction progresses.

&gt; In November, 4,400 flats will be offered in towns such as Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, Jurong West, Kallang/Whampoa and Tengah.

&gt; Another 2,000 to 3,000 flats will be offered in towns such as Geylang, Tengah and Yishun in February next year.

&gt; The exact location of these projects and the number of flats at each site will be released only three months ahead of its launch.

&gt; SINGAPORE: More rental flats will be offered to help support families waiting for their Build-to-Order (BTO) home to be completed, said the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday (Aug 3).

&gt; 

&gt; A household income ceiling of S$7,000 will also be introduced for those applying under the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme (PPHS) from Wednesday.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; In a media release, HDB said the 800 additional flats will be set aside over the next two years - almost doubling the existing 840 flats under the scheme.

&gt; ""The increased supply of flats will better support families in need of temporary housing, while they await the completion of their new BTO flats,"" said HDB.

&gt; Since 2020, the demand for interim rental housing from families awaiting their BTO flats has increased significantly, added HDB. Applications almost doubled to 2,350 in 2020, compared to 1,370 in the previous year.

&gt; 

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; To better support flat buyers affected by construction delays, HDB said it will increase the supply of flats for rental under the PPHS.

&gt; 

&gt; Of the 800 additional flats, about 200 will be ready in 2021 and progressively released for application from the fourth quarter of the year.

&gt; ""These additional flats include vacated flats at sites currently undergoing the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS), flats which are unsold, and possibly vacant staff apartments at various polytechnics that are available temporarily.""

&gt; Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said delays in BTO completion have caused PPHS tenants to now stay longer in their flats, thus slowing down the return of the units to HDB for subsequent tenants.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; The higher demand for PPHS flats was also caused by more people wanting their own space as they work from home and greater competition for open market rental from others in need of interim housing.

&gt; 

&gt; Both of these factors have been accelerated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he said in a Facebook post.

&gt; 

&gt; S$7,000 INCOME CEILING FOR PPHS RENTAL FLAT

&gt; In the release, HDB said that it will also ""finetune"" its eligibility conditions and allocation process for the scheme from Wednesday to prioritise families in greater need of temporary housing.

&gt; 

&gt; This is because the supply of flats remains limited even as HDB increases its stock of PPHS flats, it added.

&gt; 

&gt; A household income ceiling of S$7,000 will be introduced for the application of such rental flats.

&gt; ""PPHS flats are highly subsidised, and the income ceiling will help to ensure that the flats are allocated to those who are less able to afford renting a flat on the open market,"" said HDB.

&gt; Priority will also be given to married couples with children aged 18 years and below, including expectant parents.

&gt; 

&gt; HDB also noted that while the number of applications for PPHS flats has risen since 2020, about half of those invited to select a flat eventually did not do so.

&gt; This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as locational preferences, said HDB.

&gt; ""However, this also suggests that not all applicants may be in urgent need of temporary housing, and some may be able to continue with their current housing arrangements for some time,"" it added.

&gt; 

&gt; To allow people with more urgent housing needs to secure a flat more quickly, those who do not select a flat after being invited twice to do so will need to wait one year from the date of the second non-selection before they can apply for a PPHS flat again.

&gt; This applies to those who had an opportunity to select a flat but did not proceed with the selection, as well as those who did not proceed with payment after selecting a flat.

&gt; 

&gt; FLATS TO BE OFFERED ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS

&gt; PPHS exercises will now be held once every two months, instead of monthly.

&gt; HDB said the consolidation of flats over two months will provide applicants with a larger pool of flats to choose from.

&gt; 

&gt; This would also improve their chances of securing a flat in each selection exercise and reduce the need for repeated applications.

&gt; 

&gt; From the next exercise in October 2021, those interested will have 14 days to submit their application, which allows HDB to process them earlier.

&gt; PPHS, which was introduced in 2013, provides an additional interim housing option for married couples waiting for their new flats to be completed.

&gt; To qualify, the families must have booked an uncompleted flat from HDB.

&gt; The supply of such flats is limited and depends on the availability of vacant flats not needed for other purposes, such as those in vacated blocks that are not immediately needed for redevelopment.

&gt; 

&gt; ""Given the limited supply of PPHS flats, we encourage households awaiting the completion of their BTO flats to continue living with their families or consider renting from the open market,"" said HDB.

&gt; 

&gt; ""Lower-income households without any housing options may contact HDB, and we will assess if we can offer them interim rental housing (IRH) on a case-by-case basis,"" it added.

&gt; 

&gt; HDB also reminded potential home buyers to account for the waiting time of new flats, and plan ahead for interim housing options before the completion of their BTO flats.

&gt; SINGAPORE: The Housing Development Board (HDB) on Tuesday (May 25) launched 3,879 build-to-order (BTO) flats across four projects in Bukit Merah, Geylang, Tengah and Woodlands.

&gt; It also said that ongoing BTO projects could be further delayed due to tightened COVID-19 border measures affecting the construction sector.

&gt; In a press release, HDB said the flats under the May launch - the second sales exercise this year - comprise Telok Blangah Beacon and MacPherson Weave in the mature towns as well as Garden Bloom @ Tengah and Woodgrove Ascent in the non-mature towns.

&gt; Units on offer range from two-room flexi to five-room flats, meeting ""the diverse housing needs of first-timers, second-timer families, seniors and singles"", said HDB.

&gt; Prices start from S$98,000 for a two-room flexi flat at Woodgrove Ascent to S$710,000 for a four-room flat at Telok Blangah Beacon.

&gt; ""Due to site conditions and the requirement for building contractors to adhere to strict safe management measures to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 at construction sites, some projects may take longer than usual to complete,"" said HDB.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; ""Those who are in urgent need of housing may consider buying a resale flat instead where first-time buyers may enjoy up to S$160,000 in housing grants.""

&gt; HDB will also offer 2,494 units in various towns and estates under the sale-of-balance-flat exercise.

&gt; POSSIBLE FURTHER DELAY TO ONGOING PROJECTS

&gt; ""Following the tighter border measures affecting the construction sector, we expect the completion of some BTO projects to be further delayed,"" said HDB.

&gt; Advertisement

&gt; It said the six- to nine-month delay previously communicated could be extended by another three months or more, ""depending on how prolonged the situation is, and barring other unforeseen circumstances"".

&gt; ""The extent of the delay varies with each BTO project, and depends on site-specific factors such as manpower availability, the contractor’s performance and materials supply,"" it added.

&gt; ""HDB is also working with various agencies on mitigating measures to reduce the length of delays. This includes getting exemptions to allow less noisy construction activities to be carried out on Sundays and public holidays where possible,"" said the agency.

&gt; The tightened border measures include longer stay-home notice periods for all travellers from higher-risk places, and a ban on short-term visitors and long-term pass holders with recent travel history from India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.

&gt; Commenting on the delays amid the ""evolving COVID-19 situation"", Minister for National Development Desmond Lee said ""it is important that building contractors continue to adhere to strict safe management measures to prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 transmission at construction sites and dormitories"".

&gt; ""For those who are currently waiting for your BTO flats, I would like to reassure you that HDB is working hard to keep BTO projects on track, and will keep you informed on the construction progress,"" Mr Lee said in a Facebook post on Tuesday.

&gt; ""For those unable to find alternative housing arrangements in the interim with family members, relatives or on the open market, please reach out to HDB for assistance,"" he added.

&gt; UPCOMING BTO LAUNCHES

&gt; About 4,900 BTO flats will be offered in August in Hougang, Jurong East, Kallang Whampoa, Queenstown and Tampines, said HDB.

&gt; Another 3,100 to 3,600 BTO flats will be launched in November in Choa Chu Kang, Hougang, Jurong West, Kallang Whampoa and Tengah.

&gt; ""As the COVID-19 pandemic is evolving, HDB is monitoring the situation, and will make adjustments where necessary.""

d332eb6d272d63ed0906437b8fe3e8c8,"&gt; Together with my father's 80k in his CPF OA, we just might be able to get a BTO or SBF.

BTO will take time though and you seem to need the house urgently.

&gt; we went down to DBS bank to ask for a loan, and after assessing me and my father's situation, we learnt that instead of the expected 170k we could loan for 25 year tenure, we could only get 100k+ due to my father's income and age.

Did you ask what if only you take the loan and see if you they can underwrite the loan just based on you? 

&gt; I have also applied and got accepted for a part-time degree program. I am awaiting payment of school fees and have set aside 16k so that's even less savings for housing. I will be enrolled in July.

If you are taking a study loan, it will affect the amount of mortgage you can take due to MSR/TDSR. Need to review your finances carefully if you are taking up a study loan.

&gt; I am thinking of asking my father to stop working so that our combined salary is just nice below 1.5k. We will have to wait until our next reporting of income tax statement. I don't know how well this plan might work or if it might backfire on us.

But it's gross household income right? Your pay of 2.7k will still be above the threshold? Unless you mean you want to quit to qualify for the rental flat? Then you don't intend to ever make more than 1.5k a month? Please don't ruin your own future. And from HDB's website, it doesn't even seem like you definitely will get a rental flat just because your income is below 1.5k at present. I don't know how HDB assesses but if I'm the HDB officer and I see this guy who seems perfectly capable of getting paid at least 2.7k a month applying for a rental flat, I will start asking questions. Don't throw letter until you have thought things through, you may end up digging a bigger hole for yourself if you end up without a job and don't qualify for a rental flat. 

I'm not sure how much cash and CPF you have but you may want to consider doing this
- check with a bank or a mortgage broker again on the loan and your maximum affordability for a place. You can google property affordability calculator online to get a rough gauge too but the bank's assessment would be more accurate and is free;
-  then based on that affordability you can decide on your next step since you will have a better idea of whether you are in a position to buy a resale HDB. Even if you can afford to buy one, do think through whether it's worth it to do so at this point given the currently elevated prices and whether this will have an impact on the grants you can get in the future when you find a partner and want to settle down.

I think it's actually a bit hard to think things through properly when you're stressed and facing such an imminent deadline to move out. That seems like a recipe for making a rushed and potentially wrong decision with long lasting impact. You may want to consider renting a room in an ulu place first to have some breathing room to think through things properly and consider your options. Perhaps you could rent a couple of years and see if the crazy HDB prices situation improves and in the meantime, your income will increase which will allow you to get a higher loan and you can also save for your downpayment along with building up your CPF.

Another possible option is to try finding housemates and rent a whole HDB together. This could work out cheaper but may take some time depending on your network. 

&gt;I admit some of the issues I'm facing is due to our poor decision making in the past, even way before I was born. 

Please don't be so harsh on yourself. You are bearing the consequences of mistakes not made by you and you don't even sound bitter. I just want to let you know that I'm rooting for you. I don't even know what I was doing when I was 21 years old.",2021-05-23 11:00:37 UTC

cc6ae071ba6a6bab3ee3ded9b8c1df58,"Impt qn: have you received your first pay from signing on already?


1. For rental flat, salary is taken **at the point of application**. I.e. if father stops working now and you haven't enlisted, actually it is the best time to apply. Be warned though, HDB takes about **8 months** on the average to grant rental flat, save for exceptionally urgent cases (I'm talking about got Bed bound Elderly that kind). 


2. Appealing, if you've beginning to receive your income, might be tricky cuz your income exceeds by a lot alot. And appeals takes a bloody darn long time as well. HDB will likely redirect you to your nearby FSC to appeal (a bloody stupid policy), but from what is presented theres not much grounds to waiver on this regard. 


3. Off the bat, open market rental is really the best option you've, shitty as it is.  I'm wondering off the bat if your father is old enough to be eligible for 2 room flexi flat, has hdb explored with you on that?


4. See if you can negotiate with your relatives for a fixed timeline to give yourself some breathing space to make better decisions.


It's not easy having to deal with all these matters  so suddenly, hang in there!


Edit: I scrolled through the comments and gathered more info. Agreed that the biggest hurdle to appeal will your salary. Your father's declining health and unsustainable income *may* be grounds for appeal. (How old is he?) Does he require you to provide caregiving? Like bring to hospital, assist in daily living etc? This may be further grounds to argue why you need a sustainable housing in rental flat as you need to crave out time to support him, which may affect your employment which directly impacts your open market accommodation plan.


 Giving rental flat allows for greater breathing room while you works towards home ownership (might want to use this to sell to hdb that you're not planning to stay in rental flat forever).


That said, it is going to be a tight wriggle. All the best.

436cfa086edf24f60bcd47ffd7b682ca,"Hi OP. Just remember that this too shall pass. I can’t imagine going through this at 21. Your comment about being stuck in this poverty cycle really struck me, and I would like to cheer you up a bit.

For a bit of context, home ownership is not a must! Many people rent. From what I’ve seen on Western media, renting seems to be the norm in other countries. 

Renting can make you almost as rich as a home owner in Singapore!! Let me explain, but bear with me as it may get a bit confusing and it involves the concept of investing (which definitely isn’t scary at all). 

Let’s say there is a $300K resale house on the market. The rental on it is $15K/year (5% rental per year). Let’s also assume you have $85K saved (25% needed for down payment if you’re borrowing from the bank, and $10K renovations), and you make $40K/year including bonuses (with no change in salary for the next 25 years), and spend $9K/year excluding housing. 

If you choose to rent, you’ll have $16K of spare savings/year, and will also have $85K cash in the bank. If you invest this in the stock market for the next 25 years and get average returns of 7%/year, you’ll have a cool net worth of $1.5M (I can DM you the calculations if you want to).

If you choose to buy this resale house, you will have to pay $12.5K/year ($950/month using the MAS home loan calculator + maintenance cost of about $1K/year for town council and repairs). Given your $40K/year salary, you will get $18.5K in savings every year. If we assume that you put all of this $18.5K into stocks every year, and your house, after 25 years, appreciates to $550K, you will have a net worth of about $1.8M (assuming 7%/year returns in the stock market - DM for calculations). Even though you save more every month, and even though you buy your own house, you would only have a net worth that is 20% higher, 

My assumptions are quite modest. Nevertheless, if you feel like I’m spouting nonsense, that’s fine HAHA. The point I am getting at is that home ownership is not the way out of the poverty cycle, prudent financial decisions are. If you save a lot, and you invest these savings in pretty basic stuff, you can have a decent nest egg in 25 years at 45 years old, one that is comparable to a home owner’s nest egg. The key is not to focus on owning a home. The key is to devote the time to learn more about personal finance and investing. There are numerous books out there for this and at 21, if you start now, it can make a huge difference!! 

I would even go so far as to argue that home ownership can really set you back financially in some cases, especially if you buy an older flat for the sake of buying one. Don’t think of rent payments as money down the drain. Think of it as an opportunity to invest that downpayment/renovation money into something else that can yield you higher returns. Cheers!",2021-05-23 18:54:18 UTC

As many peeps mentioned earlier, the most important thing to do when making important decisions is to think long term instead. Getting BTO with your dad will only create more problems in the future. Rental seems to be a wiser decision. 21 to 35 will pass very fast. When you are 35, more options will open up to you. If you manage to get a partner before 35 and apply for BTO, you can consider giving a room to your DAD? 

In any case your situation is not ideal but not dire as well. Stay positive like your dad. I am sure your life can get better as long as you avoid making poor decisions.",2021-05-23 23:59:08 UTC

Owning property locks you into a big and illiquid investment that is also tied to your housing situation. This may be a very bad idea for people in a precarious financial situation. In particular, your ""trick"" to get your father to stop working sounds very suspicious. You seldom come out ahead by deliberately reducing your household earnings. It is likely better to continue earning your full household income, pay rental, and save any money that's left over (e.g. invest in ETFs and don't touch).",2021-05-24 02:19:40 UTC

As a long time hdb renter (since 2006) here are a few tips
1. You don't really need an agent. Use sites such as property guru or even carousell and view as much unit as possible. Agent means you have to pay agent fee..and you don't really need agent since there are many websites and portals out there that can help you.

2. Be sure to ask the landlord on whether you are allowed to cook, the bathroom usage, etc

3. Get to know your potential housemates and have a chat with them before deciding to move in.

4. If you don't mind further commute, places like woodland and yishun have the cheapest rates for rental.

5. Make sure you read the contract term properly to avoid hidden cost. E.g. Normally the landlord will have to pay for repairs of broken items or furnitures due to ordinary usage and should not charge you.

6. This is definitely renter market now as there are more supply than demand. Look around and compare",2021-05-24 05:21:54 UTC
ed6adf01d1a4f93ab205df4bea886734,"Hey bro, firstly, hang in there. You've taken steps to improve your situation and you have a lot of time on your side. Patience and discipline from here on out will serve you really well as you serve the nation in uniform. I wish you all the best during your service.

Now, just based on the financial info you provided and the short time span you have before needing to move out, find a place to rent till the end of the year that'll take you and your father. Shared rooms, whatever, that is the immediate need. And make sure it's within your budget. Money is going to be tight. Your father does not need to stop working (but do look up as many assistance avenues as you can find. Getting a counselor involved to help in this regard is very recommended). This will buy you two time to plan out the steps for next year. It's easier and less pressing when you have confirmed shelter over your heads in the short run. 

Out-of-pocket expenses will be higher than you'd like it to be but that's expected in the circumstances. If can tapao cookhouse food, tapao as much as you can bring back and as much as you can safely keep. Laundry can do in camp as well. I'm sure you know better than me at this point that many facilities are made available. Just need to dedicate some time and energy to keep overall money costs low, so that you can use that for the bigger expenses in future.

Coming back to the point on confirmed shelter, with that settled in the short-run, this is where you plan out the next 3-5 years with your father. It's great that you were accepted into a part-time bachelor's program, but I recommend postponing it for now. The resources you're going to spend in that direction can be better spent solidifying the base that you can build up in 2022. Keep in mind that it's not just money that you are spending; it's also your time and your energy, which are far more valuable. These are decisions you can make now that will pay off in the near future. You can't make up for the mistakes of the past. What you can do is be decisive for the future. 

Keep your head up. You're 21, and due reasons beyond your control, you are in the position you're in. You have the power and ability now to be 25 in 4 years, with a roof over you head, no debt, healthy family and friends (and colleagues) and maybe a convocation around the corner. And who knows, maybe the ability to throw a grand wedding for yourself.

08a145263561f0f9edd2ecd66b76fc9c,"Buying a flat right now does not seem feasible for you. If you're able to get your combined salary below 1.5k then that's great for the HDB rental but not realistic as you have to account for pay raise and bonuses. Even if you were to get by 1 year, you can't do it forever. In addition, are the two of you able to survive on the $2,900? 

$2,900 means a take home pay of about $2,400. $100 for HDB rental, $100 for utilities, $300 each for food, $100-200 for entertainment or other miscellaneous (phone, netflix, shopping, etc). You will need public transport at least for work since you can't WFH in SAF so that's $100 more. How about other essentials? e.g. Soap, Shampoo, dishwashing liquid, detergent. Does your dad need to pay off part of the loan owed to HDB in cash? How much leeway is left? 

Going private rental is probably the best solution for you right now. At least for the near future. If you're willing to stay a little more ulu, say Sembawang or Yishun, it would likely be a little cheaper. 

Once you've worked a couple of years, and perhaps after your father has retired, you could start looking for a flat again. At that point, your CPF OA should have a decent amount, and should have a little more flexibility. Assuming that you continue to earn $2,900 for the next 5 years, 23% is allocated to your OA, that would come out to $40,000 or so in your OA.

Everyone is smart, and you want to be smart too, blahblahblah. It's actually a very flawed mindset, but that is a different subject. I just want to address your social anxiety, about the cycle of poverty.

The truth is, you already broke the cycle of poverty. The real cycle of poverty is much much bleaker. Fact is, you already took advantage of your relative's kindness to stay rent free at their place. (Maybe you paid bills? I dunno) Put it another way, you were already very fortunate to have that option, else you may not even be where you are today. And where you are today, is what gives you the options to explore around and still be able to make ""educated"" choices. True poverty, only have choices handed to them.

Anyway, after you come out to work and finish studying, it should be a priority to move out with your new income stream. Unless your relative insist that you can stay, cause maybe you can ""help"" out with the house. But unfortunately, that's not the case so you are overstaying your welcome. First thing first, you need to be appreciative of everything thus far.

It would be best if the government can understand your plight and ""help"" you out. Don't we all? Heck, I want the government to help me too, but the way our government work is to help only when you are totally fked. Even after I committed suicide and survive, I got no government help, ok? It's fucked up, and actually I don't think there's a Singaporean that actually help me with my problem after that too. Life is tough, even the rich don't want to extend their hands to what they feel are people who aren't working hard enough.

Now, you aren't fked up. So they can't help, and that is the reality. If they help you, tons of people will ask why they never help them then. The government will say, our reserves will run out of money if we help everyone that needs help. So their model is for you to force yourself to help yourself, so they don't have to solve your problem. And its not a big problem if you can solve it, so that proves their model is right. It's somewhat morally flawed, but the age of chivalry is long gone. Welcome to selfish capitalism.

Rent a house, that's what you should have done in the first place. Your degree, your army has an option to sponsor you as you mentioned. Take that, use your 16k for your more immediate needs. Worst case, you go homeless and ask MSF for shelter. When they ask you why, you can tell them cause you don't want to waste money. That doesn't sounds bright, right? So now, we go back a full cycle to you having choices. And the ability to make and afford an ""educated"" choice which is to rent a short term stay. Then work out with HDB or MSF (actually it should be MSF's problem) on how you can afford your own place to stay. But everything takes time, and you need an interim solution. The keyword here is interim, not long term. Rental may ""waste"" money but in ""empowers"" you to do better now. It's important to identify what ""now"" is and stop living in the ""future"", while expecting the world to help you achieve that ""future"". That future was never yours. It could be, but that's only if you have the life for it. If you don't have the life for it, you are just depriving yourself of ""now"" which is just dumb. Once again, your situation is not fked. It's just not good enough for you. You are not stuck in the cycle of poverty, you just aren't fortunate enough to have ready made life. But you are already gaming the system with your career choice. You will be hard pressed to find such good offer elsewhere",2021-05-24 07:07:18 UTC

For the first question you might need an electrician or someone from a similar field to comment on it, but from what I know, I just make sure to use electrical products that are safety rated.   


For the second question, residential buildings built in Singapore are regulated to have fire rated walls and doors to prevent the spread of fire from one flat to another. That's the reason changing your front door will be more expensive than changing your room doors, because SCDF checks and regulates the fire protection of buildings through our submitted drawings, and inspections, before and after the building is built.   


Here's the fire code if you're intending to read up more about it: [https://www.scdf.gov.sg/firecode/table-of-content](https://www.scdf.gov.sg/firecode/table-of-content)

""Compartmentalization (fire protection) - Wikipedia"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compartmentalization_(fire_protection)

However, this only prevents the spread of fire from one apartment to another. It doesn't prevent a fire from starting in an apartment, or spreading within it. That's the responsibility of the home owner.

Good practices are to check your wiring is in good condition (not frayed, circuit breakers function properly to cut off power in the event of abnormal conditions), using approved extension cables and not overloading them, not leaving cooking or any other lighted materials (e.g. scented candles) unattended, not leaving electronic devices to charge unattended (especially personal mobility devices), not hoarding excessive flammable materials. These are common sense precautions.

Have some way to extinguish a small fire, and a plan to get out ASAP if a fire is too large. Don't leave your keys in some obscure location, such that you would have a hard time getting to them when you are in a panic.",2020-12-24 02:04:51 UTC

Vertically at the window or balcony openings, the fire code requires a spandrel or apron (essentially projections) that are supposed to serve as a break for fire leaping from one floor to the next. We don't really have the Grenfell type cladding on residential blocks here because of various reasons, including that HDB/developers don't really go for that smooth metal finish and there isn't really a big push for thermal insulation for homes, unlike commercial buildings.

Of course, how people treat their homes and common areas is a variable. That's why SCDF and Town Council frowns on hoarders and people who block the corridor access.

From your age I assume you might be buying a BTO. In SG all building before they are officially commissioned have to undergo fire safety checks and approval by SCDF. 


As some people have mentioned the walls and doors are also fire rated. The lowest rating for doors is half hour and for walls is a full hour. This means that these doors and walls should be able to withstand an active fire for that period and still be structurally sound. Fire rated doors should have a metal plate on the side of it where it gives the batch number and other information. 


Also Singapore building are vastly different from house in USA. USA tends to use wood frames and dry walls which provides little protection in an active fire. Singapore uses a lot of concrete walls which will block and hinder the spread of fire. This is what people mean by compartmentalisation. 


If you are scared I would recommend that you close all the doors at home when you are away as the doors can help protect against smoke and fire damages even if the room on the other side is on fire. It really helps and this is coming from a person who has seen it happen. 


For case 1 this isn't a big issue as most unattended cooking just results in a lot of smoke but no fire. What we normally find during such cases is that there is a lot of smoke and soot on the walls and ceiling from the first few minutes but no fire. The food inside the pot just turns into black charred remains and they would smother at most. Newer building are connected to city gas instead of cylinders, so most of the time we would turn off the gas supply to the unit and it takes care of the issue while waiting for the owner to return. 


As for fire spreading between units, this is highly unlikely due to the walls between units. Vertical spread may happen if the unit above has curtains by the windows but it is nigh impossible for a fire to spread  through the ceiling and floor of a unit. What might happen is you may experience popping of the tiles due to the heat and the floor may be uncomfortable or painfully hot to the touch. You would need to heat the floor to upwards of 500 degrees c. before you can get a spontaneous combustion of the flammable materials within the unit above. If your unit does have popping due to a fire below people inform the SCDF officers on the ground so that they may include it within our report for insurance claims. 

There was a high profile incident of a high rise building catching fire and spreading. Check out Grenfell tower fire. The aggressive vertical fire spread was due to unsafe external cladding on the building that aided the fire spread along the outside of the building. After this incident SCDF did a nation wide review of all cladding and has those with issues replaced. 



Also there is a survivor bias at work. You see the news of houses on fire but they are honestly very uncommon and fire stations are built in locations that allows us to response to most locations within 8mins. This timing was chosen as it was shown to be the time needed for the fire to fully develop. So SCDF are able to response to most cases quickly and we are able to hit the fire before it grows and spreads. 

I would say fire is a valid concern but it isn't something that should stop you from living a normal life. You probably have a higher chance of dying in a car accident as compared to your house catching fire. 


PSA: HDB compulsory fire insurance is useless. This insurance only covers the repairs of concrete wall spalling. So they do not cover the furniture and other property damage, if you want this coverage you need to engage an insurance company. 

PSA 2: smart locks are a pain for us to break into and could lead to us spending precious minute cutting through it. Also if we do break into the house due to a unattended cooking or some small incident thats a good $700 down the drain for the lock and more for the door. Normally we try to prevent unnecessary damage by using bolt cutter or such but with smart locks there is no way to work around it. We will have to cut through the lock, door and door frame.",2020-12-28 03:37:52 UTC

Honest good solution would be to scrape the whole bto idea. Actually give people who want to start a family the chance to buy subsidised housing to get married, move in, and have kids.

The current problem we have right now is that the resale flats are being bought by couples who have no other choice than to buy at those prices. A bto 5 rm costs example 500k.

3b28e41b755b3d6e2597218b02a9f89c,"One thing everyone tend not to realise about SBF is the missing of the golden opportunity window for SBF as compared to BTO. 

Every house has a TOP date. So essentially, if you buy a house that has keys available or soon but others in the area have already taken their keys, you are surely going to miss out on the boom in prices once the unit MOP, depending on how long you are lacking behind. When you are finally able to sell, the market will already be saturated with units from the same area and the price would start trending downwards. This along with the fact that SBF houses are leftover due to odd shapes/ angles, direction and floor level, will push the price down even more. 

Another thing is the number of flats available and the application rate. 

For example, TPY SBF has a application rate way higher than the BTO for now. For both 4 room and 3 room. You stand a way higher chance of getting your flat in your desired location from BTO compared to SBF. For example, the 3 room application rate is almost a sure get as of now for the BTO as compared to SBF (0.4 &amp;0.9 respectively. Subjected to changes in application in the coming days). 

If you opt for a BTO instead of SBF and choose to rent for the time being, you can actually save some money and stand a chance in getting a flat that has nice qualities that you prefer, instead of getting the leftovers.

The COVID-19 delay is probably negligible if everything goes back to track now (no second wave etc). HDB is just extending the ECD date to cover their own arse. 

SBF is traditionally and should still only be considered if you are really not the picky kind and die die want a new house as fast as possible. 

Last point to note is that even if you get your house now, renovation cost a bomb currently as they are severely lacking in manpower due to travel restrictions.

\- They group all the ""leftover"" flats together in one area. Eg mine was TPY and they lump all the units in TPY, Bidadari and JS (the latter two aren't even in TPY to be frank) together for selection. I was hoping to be able to pick a unit in TPY but it's tough because my q number was near the end of the allocation but still within it. The first 10+ in the q all went for TPY units of course.

\- So let's say you want to pick a unit where the flooring and doors have been selected, you have to pay for the previous dude ""mistake"". All these are added into the unit cost. But its ok cos I didn't wanted to wait 3 years plus for the Bidadari BTO to be completed and it cost more in fact.

\- Balloted under MCPS as I wanted to continue to stay near to my parents and I loved TPY a lot as I grew up there, just to note your parents cannot sell their flat for the next 5 years also if you pick a unit under this scheme

\- Also to note if you have the intentions to just stay until MOP and sell, you will be at a slight disadvantage as your MOP will be later than your neighbours and the rest who had got their keys earlier. When I got my key, my neighbour has already stayed for 2 years and reaching MOP soon and got bombarded with lots of property agents flyers and visits but I can only tell them not keen as I have not fulfilled 5 years MOP.",2020-11-18 08:48:38 UTC

5f668ce994ab7f6757ad3dd96c7021ae,"Step 1. Count your money.
You need around 28%~29% of the property value in Cash and CPF OA for deposit / downpayment/ stamp duty etc, Go ahead and flush your CPF empty because when you buy a property, OA and cash are essentially the same thing. Liquidate your stocks accordingly, I keep bank stocks to hedge against but thats just personal preference

Step 2. Count your money again for monthly mortgage.
Remember that your mortgage can be offset by CPF monthly contributions as well. Find out how much you are comfortable paying every month, including the maintenance fee (which is around 300ish a month as well as property tax another 100~200ish). You can then get a loan approval on what is the maximum loan from the bank. That number will be much higher than you expect because mortgage brokers are greedy bastards. Use the number that you are comfortable with.

Step 2a. The loan you want should be the SIBOR based one, interests rate are low now because the economy is shit so that is a good option. Meanwhile, get a cheque book if you haven't already

Step 3. Now you have the price range that you know what is within reach. I don't think you will exceed 1.2 million unless you are really loaded with 10k monthly salary or will be willing to eat white bread only for next 10-20 years

Step 4. Go to propertyguru and filter off by that limit and whether you want resale or freehold or new launch. Start messaging the property agents to visit the places while waiting for loan approval. The listed price on propertyguru can usually be negotiated within 10~15%, but it all depends on luck and whether there are other people bidding for it.

Use https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/transaction/search.action
to find out previous transactions

A lot of agents will push you to visit their new launch and convince you that as a first time buyer, your low stamp duty is really profitable. Just remember that the new launches give them a much higher commission cut.


Step 5. You will never be truly happy with a property purchase. You will feel slight injustice at the flaws the agent hid from you, or whether you could have negotiated a better price. Don't sweat it too much and as long as it ticks your major checklist its good enough.

My consideration during purchase was that it would be a form of forced-savings/investment, but a place that I would eventually move into, so it had to be near a train station, preferably new (no need to reno), and a relatively larger development (typically lower monthly maintenance). 99-year lease is fine, as I wasn’t looking for en-bloc potential. Had a friend follow suit but he bought a smaller condo unit and did 80% loan.

In hindsight, I wouldn’t have rented out because tenant was a nightmare with payments (although the rent did defray my costs as I worked to increase my income). I would also have chosen a location much closer to my parents. Personally, housing loan is still a psychological liability because it’s a huge quantum on a single income. But other than an initial 50k from CPF, I’ve never touched CPF since, so my CPF acts as a buffer if I ever lose my job. Also, I’ve turned 35, and am thinking of downgrading to a resale flat. Condo-living is quite overrated in my opinion.",2020-11-16 12:17:39 UTC

It was to be a home, so I looked for features that I like: small estate (fewer residents), near MRT, good layout, good location. I was less fussed about likelihood of capital gains or rental yields, as long as the price/mortgage is acceptable and I know I can afford the monthly repayments. I was very cautious about the financial part, and made sure to calculate not just the monthly outlay but also whether I can afford to repay if I am without a job for a period of time.

He took a bank loan and wiped out most of his savings for the downpayment. He bought it because at that point he really didn't think he would ever settle down at all. End 2017 we met and fell in love and etc., and made the decision to get married in 2018 (gotta say that I did not fall for him because he had a condo though, I would much prefer to settle down in a HDB). Fortunately for him, he worked in sales and was able to save for our wedding (and more) within the next year. He also doesn't fork out any cash to pay for the condo's mortgage because it's all through CPF for now, so that's really a huge relief. The condo unit value has now surpassed $1m but we're still undecided on whether to move into it (currently pending TOP) or to rent it out.

I reckon it's possible for you if you're prepared to commit to the huge downpayment at the start? However, learning from my husband's story, I also would not discount unexpected life decisions e.g. meeting someone you actually want to spend the rest of your life with and perhaps other occasions that may cost you quite a bit.

93194eb5afe5852cf02e559fa6d559d0,"&gt; BTO Sales is launched. You are given one week to apply for the flat. **I  recommend applying as soon as you can because I think the ballot number  is based on order of application.** 

I think this may not be accurate? AFAIK, ""first come first served"" applies to open booking of balance flats, not BTO ballot.

&gt;Flat buyers can apply online anytime and receive a queue number for flat booking on a first-come-first-served basis, and book a flat as early as the next working day, where possible. This option enables more home seekers to move into their homes earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Please note that no priority or privilege applies for queue numbers to book a flat. Those are randomly generated for flat applicants who are successful in the ballot.

&amp;#x200B;

Found this bit too but it seems hdb didn't maintain their hdbspeaks domain lol

&gt;This is how the ballot system works. The BTO ballot is done via a computerised system with a built-in algorithm to ensure fairness to all applicants while reserving a certain percentage of the flat supply to those with priority schemes. The priority schemes thus improve an applicant’s chance of being considered for the ballot, but do not assure the applicants of a favourable queue number ahead of non-priority scheme applicants. During every BTO exercise, applicants under the various priority schemes will be randomly shortlisted before non-priority applicants. All the shortlisted applicants will then be assigned a random queue number.

I moved out when I was 19, never regretted it once, didn’t even contemplate moving back even if I was worried financially. The relationship with my family improved, and I learned to see things from a different distance. Learning to pay household bills, manage household chores etc is also a different life skill to develop. Having a financial commitment like rent will prep you to pay for other heavier stuff later in life.

It also probably made me in a better state/position to develop my career, I had more mental and emotional bandwidth to deal with stress from other parts of my life. You wouldn’t want your family to be the source of stress that would leave you no energy to work, date, be a good friend, etc. Our mental/emotional state affects everything in our lives, including how we see ourselves and that will determine the choices we make.

Without going into the calculations, I’d say that renting is a money pit. It’s been more than 10 years now and I don’t even wanna think how much I’ve paid. In the early days after graduating I was definitely living hand to mouth. 

But if I didn’t move out, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. Having my own place gave me the physical and mental space to learn about myself, build relationships and be less emotionally bogged down. 

It’s not for everyone, for sure. But if you’re truly unhappy at home, and you’re willing to accept that it’s money that you won’t see a return on, then maybe renting is something you should look at. 

“But what about buying?”

Fair point. When I was moving out I gave it some serious thought. But making a big-ticket purchase like that just wasn’t something I was comfortable with doing in my early 20s.

I felt that it was worthed it while saving hard for my own house.

Think of it this way, life is meant to be celebrated and enjoyed. Dont trap yourself in that money cycle. I’m not saying that you should max out your credit card and enjoy your life. But do what makes you happy while making adjustments to your lifestyle.

For me when I started renting. I stop going to bars and clubs (I can just chill at home). I also stopped all starbucks and reduced bubble tea craving to once a month social outings. Bought a small personal aircon, saved $100plus a mth. If need to socialise, invite friends over, get them to contribute food and drinks. Definitely cheaper than eating out.

873b49eadb6a04c991d6d51554211c4d,"My proposal in the other threads - 

1. People should not be allowed to own HDB + private. Living space already incredibly limited in Singapore, why do you want said living space to be something to be invested/speculated on? Leave the realm of speculation to people who want to own multiple privates, but HDB should not be part of that equation.


2. HDB needs to have a clean break now. New HDBs come with the ruling that these new units can only be sold back to the government. These HDB will never enter the secondary market, so the price of these units can be lowered to create truly affordable housing. It also incentivizes people who get them to start families when they are younger. 


3. This also prevents ""lottery striking"" for people who ballot successfully for central regions since there isn't any inherent increased value when selling back to the government (only ""lottery striking"" is having a more convenient location while staying in the HDB)

4. People who want to subsequently upgrade to private can do so, but will need to sell the new HDB back within 6-12 months of the purchase of the private property. They are then allocated to the waitlist of people who want the new HDBs.


The idea eventually is to make prices of HDB go down to ""affordable housing"" prices while leaving private property to run via market forces. There will always be people who want the status/amenities that comes with private properties and they can upgrade to that, but it should come at the cost of giving up their HDB to someone who actually wants/needs it.",2020-09-11 02:40:04 UTC

4b8a1513df6c3fa98d8d4873ff45e44b,"While good starting point, I have a few things to say:

1) maximum reselling price, the rule of not allowing people to own two HDB is sufficient. What if there is crazy inflations in between? And BTO prices are not in lined with inflation. 

2) minimum occupancy period: cannot make the assumption that all living in mature estate are for profits, some want to live near parents. If some people get their BTO at age 45 onwards, 20 years later, they’ll be above 65 years old. This will give them issues when arranging mortgage for their next place due to age restrictions.

3) HDB sizes
While I like this idea.but you cannot punish the mature estates (using poor vs rich lens to view things is only going to cause more problems in future). Also, combining with occupancy period, it’ll only drive up prices of the fringe towns around mature estates and mature estates will be in this weird limbo in 10 years time. 

4) amenities is more local MPs to determine the needs. Generally not a good idea to drive up government spending. I think with the idea of self-reliance, sometimes it’s better to carry own umbrella/brave the weather than asking to build a sheltered walkway making the entire place an extension of the mrt station. 

One good example of amenities dependent on location is the silver zones on roads. 

5) BTO entitlement
Cannot tell people if they can upgrade or downgrade, again, it’s not always a profiteering situation. For example a family with 3 kids all married out and the couple is getting on their years might want a smaller place 3/4 room instead of a 5 room flat. 

For the bottom part:
With the governments marketing pitch, I’m glad LW got the guts to say it as it is. 

Some people prefer quiet areas away from mrt 

Location and pricing still places an important part of housing to distribute the population.

57b0f6fec9c3b7d7cde161078f2889a5,"I am of the opinion that all new HDBs should be converted into rental units. This would prevent people profiteering off the BTO system akin to striking a lottery. Prices for BTOs can then be decoupled from that of private properties, and rental can be charged at more affordable living rates. This also gives people the freedom to pack up and move depending on various needs (schools for kids, new workplace location, preference for more nature) without feeing like they are pigeon holed into just bidding for the most lucrative option. 

For people concerned about wanting to own their own property and despise the idea of paying rent, there are already many investments out there that surpass property investments, and the idea that one needs to own a property is archaic at this point. Furthermore we are unlikely to see the same levels of profits our forefathers were able to accrue from property given how our country has plateaued off. With stamp duty, depreciation of assets (esp in the case of HDB’s 99-year leases), maintenance, many flats that are not in situated in prime, highly demanded locations might already be incurring significant losses. 

They’ve let this HDB monster grow into too big a problem. Selling the idea that HDBs were such a good investment in the early years was such a politically lucrative option. It gave people a home, it made them feel like they owned a part of the state, and they saw great returns on their capital.

For Reno, unless you have very clear and strong views on what you want your home to look like, just get the basics and don’t go crazy so you can pay up the mortgage quicker. These days the job market is so unstable and things change so fast - it’s better to get something classic and durable that you can live with for a long time than feel like you have to renovate or refurnish every few years. It’s easy to update a classic white and wood/black decor with a few new cushion covers and some new curtains, but if you’ve gone eclectic and painted the place orange with built in cabinets etc you’ll need to redo the whole space if you start hating it. Some people know exactly what they want though, nothing wrong with that. 

Look at your life and what it will be for the next 5 years and plan for that (especially if you plan to have kids or more than one kid). You don’t want to have to carve out a second bedroom in your living room because you had two kids and only one tiny bedroom, because you chose to break down a wall for an extra large living/ dining /bar area or master bedroom.

f38180fd61d9904ab717a9f45273d553,"My profile: Late-30s and single AF. I had been wanting to get a place of my own for a really long time so did a ton of research between 2RM BTOs vs resale. The 2RM BTOs were usually in very ulu locations and those near an MRT were always super oversubscribed. Hell, I already waited 35 years and even though I could save a lot getting a BTO you'd have to survive the balloting and then wait 4 - 5 years for it to build before you finally get the keys. That would mean that I could only move in when I'm in my 40s. So I gave up on waiting for a BTO and decided to get a resale. In the end, I decided on a 40+ year old 3RM flat near town which was a 5min walk to an MRT for about $300K.  

One warning about buying a 30 - 40+ year old flat is that you are buying a DEPRECIATING asset. You are most probably going to lose money if you try to sell it after the MOP so if you do buy one, make sure that it's gonna be your 'forever home.' The reason why nobody wants a 40+ year old flat is because there are restrictions on CPF usage (Google to find out more) and under some circumstances you might not be able to get a housing loan for it.  
 
Anyhow, shortly after I bought the place I switched jobs and now my parent's place is much nearer to my workplace so it makes more sense for me to stay with them most of the time. Haha... ah well.",2020-09-09 06:19:22 UTC

Have you considered your budget and size of the flat you want to get first? 
Calculating how much loan (I assume hdb loan) you can get will really help narrow down each area you can buy from. 

Honestly I wouldn't recommend buying near Serangoon central just on price alone. 

After that you also need to consider the size of the flat. If you are planning to have kids or not. Whether you want dedicated spaces (eg. a study, especially since wfh maybe a thing from now on) and also now do feel about cleaning the house. 

Next is also to budget for your renovations, furniture and electronics, which I think will be the biggest cash drain (assuming you are servicing your loan through CPF). I bought my flat (40yrs 3rm HDB) at the start of the year, and my reno costed ard 44k. Extensive work had to be done for the kitchen since the previous owner had not updated it since the 80s, i also hacked half a wall off my kitchen for a semi-open concept. I did very little to the rest of the house (didn't even hack the floor tiles), and no carpentry work in the rooms. So maybe this can be a reference point for you.

1) Look up Propertyguru and plan for a full day of viewings in the area you're interested in. I was able to fit in 5-6 viewings on a Saturday 

2) You can save the 1% agent fee by handling your own application and negotiation. There are tutorials on the HDB portal or you could join their hdb resale seminar for a small fee ($20? but worth it as it was super detailed and they'll provide you with a stack of useful PowerPoint slides)

3) To avoid paying additional COV cash for the flat, lookup the historical resale prices in the area or even the same block and use that as reference. If your offering price is the same or below that amount chances are that you might not need to pay any cash overlay

4) Once you've decided on a place and made an offer, you'll need to pay a cash amount known as the OTP (option to purchase - between $1-$1000 to be negotiated between seller and buyer) to the owner and submit a request for valuation by hdb. HDB will appoint a valuer to derive a valuation. The cash you need to overlay will be your offer price minus the valuation. In my case the valuation and my offer came back to be the same so no cash top up from me.

5) More specifically for Serangoon, the prices are higher the closer the block is to NEX/Serangoon MRT ($500++k for 4rms, $700+k). Most of these units are corridor units (which I absolutely hate) so I ended up getting a unit near NYJC at block 30X where the lifts were retrofitted on.

For tampines, the newer plots are at central 7/8, and it's like 600-800k for 5 room. There is a bto at the mosque so for next 3 years it'll be noisy.

For the same price, you can take one mrt down to pasir ris, street 52/53, walking distance to MRT, you can buy an EA. Of course it's about 30 years old but from outside it doesn't look that old.

Serangoon flats are mostly old, and condition is very different from Tampines, I can understand how you feel if you had viewed any Serangoon units 😂 

Here are some things to note :
Due to covid, most people decided not to sell, so in the market there aren't much units, so end up the units that were on market for months are sold. When these units are sold, people need to find a new place to stay, end up most area are only left with low floor / poor facing units. In short, there aren't much in the market now.

What to lookout for :
- Neighbors, I don't know how you can identify whether your neighbor is a troublesome one or not, but I would suggest like googling site:straits times and like blk xxx serangoon to see if there're any news of pesky neighbors
- avoid direct west sun units, it's going to be very warm. Naturally north south facing units are going to be very expensive, so I would suggest considering those with semi west sun, view during the late afternoons / evenings so you have a feel of the heat. A little sun in the house isn't always bad.
- look for areas with proximity to childcare, especially those that don't have to cross the road. It will be so much easier if your in-laws aren't going to help you take care and if you're planning to have kids.
- lookout for coffeeshop/supermarkets, if you get a block with those downstairs, it's going to be noisy, try avoiding those if you're sensitive to noises.
- if the unit you're viewing is facing the road, stand near the windows and pay attention and see if you can accept the noise",2020-09-09 14:19:09 UTC

b8f7a9a969606969393db702fb3bd3cc,"When I bought my first flat, I went for a resale cause like your hubby, I wanted to be close to my parents. For that reason alone, I had to pay resale price for an older flat with older designs in an otherwise-not-exactly-great location. As is with most resale flat since it’s usually in a mature estate with established neighborhoods. 

But fast forward to 10 years later... given a choice I would have gone for BTO. Better capital appreciation, newer design (like bigger window), and frankly speaking, I don’t think the distance would have stopped me from visiting my parents as often as I am (have since moved away). Ultimately, Singapore is really tiny and the concept of having to stay near parents is overrated. Of course if there were future and important considerations like kids for example - planning for parents to babysit children in daytime - then being close makes sense. 

Point is: your lifestyle will be what matters the majority of the time. The part where it benefits u being close to parents comparatively might be just a smaller part.

Of course there are Other factors like, how urgently u need a place cause bto takes years to build. But there are also plenty of other arguments against, such as renovation, etc.

3b995903116ad437e111e0b175dd2377,"SINGAPORE - For many Singaporeans, successfully balloting for a Build-To-Order (BTO) flat in a centrally located mature housing estate is akin to striking the lottery.

Competition is stiff in the hotly sought-after estates of Toa Payoh, Geylang and Bishan, with the number of applicants per available flat sometimes veering into double digits, especially for five-room flats.

The reason behind it is the limited number of flats put out by the Housing Board (HDB) in the central region of Singapore.

In the last five years, there has not been a single five-room BTO flat launched outside of the Bidadari estate, which is part of Toa Payoh town.

This comes even as HDB launched 9,273 four-room BTO flats in centrally located mature estates since 2015.

In contrast, only 642 five-room flats were launched in the same time frame.

These flats are spread out in Bidadari across three BTO projects: Alkaff Vista, which was launched in November 2015; Alkaff Oasis in February 2016; and [Woodleigh Hillside in May 2017.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/geylang-and-bidadari-flats-most-popular-in-latest-bto-offer)

This means there are 14 times fewer five-room flats compared with four-room flats in the central region.

In the towns of Bishan, Geylang, Kallang/Whampoa and other parts of Toa Payoh, four-room flats are the biggest flat type available in recent BTO projects.

According to the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) masterplan, the central region comprises the towns of Bishan, Toa Payoh, Bukit Merah, Bukit Timah, Geylang, Marine Parade, Kallang, Novena, Tanglin and Queenstown.

The central region also includes the Southern Islands and a central area consisting of, among others, the central business district and Orchard.

In response to queries from The Straits Times, HDB cited space constraints as one of the reasons behind the limited supply of five-room BTO flats in the last five years.

""While flats in mature towns and estates are popular with flat buyers, land for new housing in these areas is limited. Hence, more four-room and smaller BTO flats are provided to allow more families to live closer to the city,"" "" said HDB.

In addition, around 500 five-room flats in the central region have been offered in the last five years under the Sale of Balance Flats exercises, Re-Offer of Balance Flats exercises - which has since been scrapped -and open booking of flats.

These balance flats are from past BTO sales launches, extra Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme (Sers) replacement flats and older flats sold back to the HDB for various reasons.

These flats are in Bukit Merah, Kallang/Whampoa, Queenstown and Toa Payoh, among others, said HDB.

HDB added that it offers a wide range of flats in various locations, with different designs, prices and flat types to cater to households with different needs and budgets.

Among these, the four-room flats, which come with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, remain the ""mainstay"" of HDB's BTO supply. They are typically 90 sq m in size.

""They are an affordable option to meet the needs of families and have been popular with first-timers,"" said HDB.

Five-room flats, which also come with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, are slightly larger at 110 sq m.

In [the recent August BTO sales exercise,](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/hdb-flats-in-latest-bto-exercise-oversubscribed-one-day-after-their-launch) only projects in mature towns outside of the central region offered five-room flats. These are Tampines and Pasir Ris in the east and Ang Mo Kio in the north-east.

The other two mature estates - Bishan and Geylang - only offered three-room and four-room flats.

The next Bishan site in the upcoming November BTO launch will not have any five-room flats either, but rather some 1,500 two-room flexi, three-room and four-room flats.

Only the Toa Payoh (Bidadari) site will offer five-room flats, along with three-room and four-room flats, for a total of 1,230 units.

In planning the BTO flat supply, HDB said it takes a ""comprehensive approach"", taking into account factors such as population growth, demographic changes and prevailing market conditions.

Analysts interviewed said decreasing family size may play a role, with bigger families pushed out of the central area. 

""The city centre locations attract more younger buyers, who may only be small household size, and they would prefer accessibility convenience more than flat size,"" said Dr Sing Tien Foo, director of the Institute of Real Estate and Urban Studies at the National University of Singapore (NUS).

""With the limited supply, larger families may either have to pay higher prices for resale flats in the city areas or move further away to new or mature estates, where more five-room BTO flats are available.""

NUS Associate Professor of Sociology Tan Ern Ser said that the social characteristics of four-room and five-room flat buyers may not be ""significantly different"" and there is nothing to stop a family which can afford a five-room to go for a four-room flat.

""It does mean that those who could afford the larger size flats would be somewhat at a disadvantage, given that mature towns and residential housing nearer to the CBD are seen as more desirable location-wise. One could argue that this may be seen as a way to redistribute advantages of class,"" he said.

Dr Jeffrey Chan, assistant professor at the Singapore University of Technology and Design's humanities, arts and social sciences faculty, said larger flats may also be even more popular down the line if working from home becomes a permanent trend, as homes will also have to function as work spaces. 

But analysts say it still may take some time to shift the Singaporean mindset of wanting to live in a central area for convenience.

NUS' Dr Sing said: ""The pandemic may have caused some disruption to work-home commuting arrangements... but housing is a laggard in demand and it will take years for the transformation to take shape. By then, the work-life-play location boundary will be blurred.""",2020-09-06 04:21:33 UTC

You never know. Go to the house that you set your eyes on a few times, you can even visit the seller on your own after your agent has bring you once. Not all sellers are nice, but all sellers will be interested to sell it to you if you know your game. 

3) **Renovating your house should be factored into your budgeting of your purchase of the flat.** Just because the place looks nice doesn't mean there won't be ant nest or lizard nest in the back of the wall. Just because the place looks spacious and clean doesn't mean the renovation will be fast and cheap. Some house has so inbuilt things that you don't even like/use and hacking them down cost money. Some house hack away walls/ built their own walls to make another room out. Always look at the original floorplan and decide from there how you want to design your house.",2020-08-19 12:21:18 UTC

No. 1 is so true. The agents I had kept bringing me to units that were slow moving. I ended up looking up on my own and found a great unit myself. 

Sometimes the seller agent will also try to sneak in their friends to suddenly appear as your agent. Politely decline if you have no interest. The other strategies they like to do is coop and arrange same viewing at the same time and pressure you into negotiating. Stay calm and objective and have ideally a check list after a few viewing to know what are your wants and no go. 

The other thing that I got real pissed is the bank loan from their ""Registered"" bankers. The interest provided were higher than what if you did your due diligence and approached the bank directly. If you do the math and compound it, it's easily 50-60k higher depending on your loan period. 

Never give your name to the agent as they can lock you in in their system and when you approach the bankers in the branch, they have to refer you back to the banker that locked in first. I rather you decline and go straight into the branch to ask for the rates and offer thrt provide.

Renovation is another story. I had went with some of the designer IDs and had so many bad experience. The award winning ones have impressive designs but if you drill deep, the materials they use are of lower quality. Mock up don't have the cabling trunks so it look nicer. I ended up contracting a contractor and just googled some of the styles I like on the internet.

4fb6a07700a80441460d3b046141233f,"&gt; 1) Property agents may not act in your best interest There's an inherent conflict of interest since most remuneration arrangement are based on a certain percentage of the purchase/sale price. If you are a buyer, your agent may not be genuine in his/her effort when it comes to bargaining with the counter party. Allow me to digress, if you're a seller and are reading this, your agent may choose to conceal offers that s/he deems too low, even though you're desperate to sell or had explicitly instructed the agent to relay all offers (happened to my aunt, she ended up selling her unit directly to a buyer who approached her and they figured that the agent had dismissed his offer and lied to my aunt that the buyer wasn't interested). Workarounds include engaging agencies/agents that employ fixed commission remuneration arrangement, or if you have the time, DIY.


I find it strange that this occurred. Property agents generally get somewhere between 1-5% of the transaction price right?

If the offer is $350k, and the owner was asking $400k, and property agent fee is 5%, that's a $47.5k difference for the owner and a $2.5k difference for the property agent. As an agent, I would want to close as many deals as possible, as quick as possible, and convince the owners to take the offer so I can move on and save myself the hassle of showing the flat to more people.",2020-08-19 13:13:22 UTC

&gt; HDB has received a total of 17,947 applications a day after launch. 

&gt; The 7,862 new flats launched by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) on Wednesday (12 August) received robust interest from buyers, with all flats types being oversubscribed.

&gt; As of 11am on Friday (14 August), the two-room flexi flats registered an application rate of 1.4 or a total of 2,573 applications, while the three-room and bigger flats posted an application rate of 3.0 or a total of 17,947 applications.

&gt; In fact, the 163 two-room flexi flats at Keat Hong Verge in Choa Chu Kang received 286 applications or an application rate of 1.8, while Bishan Tower’s 120 units received 227 applications or an application rate of 1.9.

&gt; Demand for bigger flats was higher, with the five-room flats at Ang Mo Kio’s Kebun Baru Edge recording an application rate of 10.3. A total of 2,240 applicants were vying for the 438 five-room flats at UrbanVille @ Woodlands, and 1,245 applicants were battling for the 325 five-room flats at Pasir Ris’ Costa Grove.

&gt; Meanwhile, the four-room flats at Dakota One in Geylang also registered high application rate at 8.9 or 2,959 applications for the 334 units offered. Parc Residences @ Tengah’s four-room flats received 832 applications for the 281 units available or an application rate of 3.0.

&gt; For the three-room flats, UrbanVille @ Woodlands and Dakota One proved popular among buyers, with application rates for such flats at 3.2 and 3.9, respectively.

&gt; HDB launched a total of 11 housing projects across the non-mature towns of Tengah, Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands as well as the mature towns of Bishan, Ang Mo Kio, Pasir Ris, Geylang and Tampines. The application period for the flats will close on 18 August.

&gt; There is no Sale of Balance Flats (SBF) exercise for this month.

&gt; In November, HDB will offer around 5,700 Build-to-Order (BTO) flats in Bishan, Tampines, Sembawang, Tengah and Toa Payoh, of which those in Tengah will have shorter waiting time.

&gt; Another 3,500 BTO flats in Bukit Batok, Tengah, Kallang Whampoa and Toa Payoh will be launched in February 2021.

&gt; On Aug. 12, HDB launched 7,862 flats for sale.

&gt; The BTO exercise involves flats located in the non-mature estates of Choa Chu Kang, Tengah, Woodlands and mature estates Ang Mo Kio, Bishan, Geylang, Pasir Ris, and Tampines.

&gt; Applications so far

&gt; Within a day, HDB received over 15,000 applications for these flats.

&gt; The data for the number of flat applications thus far, as well as the supply was made available on Thursday (Aug. 13).

&gt; The application period is one week long, from Aug. 12 to 18, 2020. The number of applications received is also updated at 8am, 11am, 2pm and 5pm daily.

&gt; Here's the full table of numbers as of Aug. 13, 2pm, for three-room and larger flats:

&gt; Projects that are particularly popular include Dakota One, located in Geylang, with 2,272 applicants for 334 four-room flats.

&gt; Five-room flats in Ang Mo Kio are also popular, with over 1,000 applicants applying for 140 units.

&gt; Four-room and five-room flats in Woodlands have also seen over 1,700 applicants in a single day.

&gt; Many of the applicants in mature estates are not first-time applicants.

&gt; In total, 13,864 applicants have applied for 6,041 units involving three-room or larger units.

&gt; Here's the number of applications received for two-room flexi flats:

&gt; The final update on the total number of applications received will be on Aug. 19 at 2.00pm, after application closes at midnight on Aug. 18.

&gt; On Aug. 13, HDB also put out a Facebook post with a nifty infographic collating the starting prices of the BTOs across different estates, excluding grants:

&gt; The next BTO launch will take place in November 2020.

&gt; There will be around 5,700 BTO flats being offered in Bishan, Sembawang, Tampines, Tengah and Toa Payoh.

&gt; A generous Singaporean man is offering to let Malaysians stranded here the next two weeks stay in his new and unfurnished Build To Order HDB flat in Bukit Batok for free.

&gt; The selfless offer was put up on Facebook on March 20:

&gt; The post has been shared 10,000 times, with many expressing appreciation for the man’s openness and unconditional assistance.

&gt; The man, whose Facebook name is Siam Kia, wrote:

&gt; To Malaysian in Singapore that still can’t get a place to stay for this 2 weeks as Malaysia Lockdown due to COVID-19 Virus. I offering help but If you don’t mind to stay at my New BTO unit @ Bukit Batok for free. FYI: have electricity and water But No flooring and No rooms doors. PM me if you don’t mind to stay with that condition. At Least you have a shelter from rain and a place to shower. I can provide: portable light and fan.

&gt; He also uploaded two accompanying photos of the unfurnished flat that is still lacking doors but has water and electricity running:

&gt; The man’s offer to put up Malaysians come in the wake of news that not all who crossed the border into Singapore could find proper accommodation here, following Malaysia’s hasty lockdown that came into effect from March 18 to 31 to stem the spread of Covid-19 infections.

&gt; Those who were hard pressed to find a place almost overnight to stay in Singapore resorted to sleeping in public areas.

&gt; These stranded Malaysians have seen received help from regular Singaporeans, as well as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth.

&gt; Malaysians found sleeping rough are being put up in temporary living quarters set up overnight by the authorities.

&gt; Those who are more fortunate have been put up in proper hotels with access to the full suite of services.

They will know who to talk to, to get you a room with the other foreign students, or maybe a student hostel. Some may even be able to swing a job for you at the school, or know other avenues you can approach.

There should also be financial officers you can talk to, in order to get bursaries for poor students, or maybe you can apply for a education loan in order to pay for your school fees. This is what they are for after all! You can apply now and the interest only starts after you graduate, by then you should be able to find a job and slowly pay it back. Worse comes to worse, you can defer school for a few semesters and find a job so you can pay for rent and school fees. After you get the money, you can come back with no problem under their approval.

Unfortunately you are already 20. Whilst it is the norm in Singapore and most of Asia for parents to let their children live with them, give them food and allowance, as well as pay school fees, you ARE technically already an adult and its not illegal for them to refuse to do so. I think that's why social workers/court cannot help you, your parents have not actually done anything wrong. So you might want to double check if they are actually obligated to pay anything for you since you already 20, and if not, there's no use contacting social agencies anymore.

There's always the option of working for rent. There's a lot of dorms out there that need people to work and keep an eye on the residents, as well as do other things such as maintenance, plan events etc. For example NUS High sometimes recruit dorm parents to keep an eye on the students who board at school, and they provide rooms so you can stay there and work. That's something you can try too.

Don't listen to your father and let his negativity get you. If you can't use a phone because bills not paid, switch to a pre-paid if possible. Also polys won't expel you if you don't pay your school fees.

&gt; SINGAPORE - The Housing Board has launched 4,089 flats for sale on Wednesday (Sept 11), one day after Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong announced higher grants and higher income ceilings for flat buyers.

&gt; A total of 3,373 Build-To-Order (BTO) flats in Punggol and Tampines are up for sale, and they range from two-room flexi to five-room flats.

&gt; Prices start from $109,000 (excluding grants) for a two-room flexi flat in Punggol, and from $312,000 (excluding grants) for a four-room flat in Tampines.

&gt; The HDB noted that with the new Enhanced CPF Housing Grant giving eligible first-timer families with a monthly income of up to $9,000 up to $80,000, buyers could buy a two-room flexi flat in Punggol for as little as $29,000 after housing grants.

&gt; Also up for sale are 716 Re-Offer of Balance Flats in mature and non-mature estates. These are unsold flats from the sales exercise last November.

&gt; About 12 per cent of these are already completed, while the rest are under construction.

&gt; The HDB said those with more urgent housing needs or who are less particular about flat attributes may wish to apply for these flats.

&gt; Application for the flats opens from Wednesday and will end on Sept 17.

&gt; In November, the HDB will offer another 4,500 BTO flats in Ang Mo Kio, Tampines and Tengah. A further 3,000 BTO flats in Sembawang and Toa Payoh will be released next February.

&gt; In a Facebook post on Wednesday after the HDB announced the sale of the flats, Mr Wong said: ""With the enhancements announced... more first-timer home buyers will be able to access affordable housing options. I encourage you to consider your options carefully and make prudent housing choices. ""

resale grant under non citizen spouse scheme, unless you have a SC or PR kid then you can get the family grant. amt is half that of families, with a combined income limit I believe of 12k

no, as she cannot be a co-owner of a hdb flat. the max loan eligibility is based entirely on your income. but her salary is considered for your grant eligibility.

83bd2e236d576217db87c0a1d195ec51,"&gt; # Condo features at a HDB price? You could get this at your new BTO

&gt; SINGAPORE - New Housing Board flats will now come with condo-like finishings at a fraction of the cost.

&gt; These sleeker and more modern fittings - such as larger tiles and concealed floor traps - will be installed in new Build-to-Order (BTO) projects launched since February this year.

&gt; The new flats will incur marginally higher costs that HDB will absorb, and does not affect the house pricing, a spokesman said on Tuesday (June 4).

&gt; Mr Jansen Foo, deputy director of HDB's Building Quality Group, said the net increase in cost is minimal as HDB has been able to achieve economies of scale. It is thus able to absorb the cost.

&gt; The HDB has adopted several practices more befitting of private condominiums in recent years, such as pushing structural walls and beams to the side to encourage open plan layouts, as well as open-concept kitchens last year.

&gt; ""This year, we took this one step further to improve the range of fittings provided in our new flats for a sleeker look. HDB is constantly improving the design of our flats to suit the changing needs of our residents,"" said Mr Foo.

&gt; The new fittings include a scratch-resistant laminated timber main door with better finishing, which replaces the timber veneered doors in older flats.

&gt; 

&gt; Wrought iron gates will be replaced with steel entrance gates, which offer more modern designs.

&gt; Thumb-turn knobs will be featured on these new gates instead of the traditional key inserts - this allows residents to open their gates from the inside without a key, enabling them to escape quickly in fire emergencies.

&gt; Instead of more breakable ceramic tiles, glazed porcelain ones will be used in kitchens and bathrooms as they are more resistant to wear and tear.

&gt; Kitchens and bathrooms will also have larger floor tiles. Kitchen floors will be fitted with 600mm x 600mm tiles instead of 300mm x 600mm ones, while bathroom floor tiles will have larger tiles of 300mm x 600mm, replacing the old 300mm x 300mm ones.

&gt; The HDB said these larger tiles allow ""better visual continuity"" from the kitchen to the living area, and also make cleaning easier.

&gt; Bathrooms will include a new range of dual flush low capacity water closets with a wide range of modern designs.

&gt; 

&gt; Concealed floor traps will replace plastic floor traps in bathrooms, giving bathrooms a more sophisticated finish. ST PHOTO: LIM YAOHUI

&gt; 

&gt; Concealed floor traps will replace plastic floor traps in bathrooms, giving bathrooms a more sophisticated finish.

&gt; Ramps at thresholds will be replaced with a 20mm drop, giving flats a more contemporary look and layout, while still remaining accessible for people in wheelchairs, HDB said.

&gt; This change was made in response to feedback from residents, who said that the ramps let water seep out of the bathrooms when residents cleaned them.

&gt; A streamlined design for the door and window ensemble between the kitchen and service yard will also be offered - top-hung windows will replace the traditional louvred vent windows, making windows more durable and easier to clean.

&gt; The windows provide more flexibility for design for homeowners, HDB said.

&gt; 

&gt; Future home owners said they are pleased with the new layouts for upcoming BTO flats.

&gt; ""The new windows will provide better privacy. It also makes homes more aesthetically pleasing,"" said Mr Ari Haikal Subtu, 24, a first-time flat buyer whose house will be among the first few to receive the new fittings.

&gt; Undergraduate Ms Melanie Heng, 24, who bought her BTO flat in February, said: ""It's a welcome change to create a more modern and chic look, in comparison to the usual traditional features of a HDB flat,"" .

&gt; ""I'm happy to see that floor tiles will be more resistant to wear and tear as this is the element of the house which needs to withstand the test of time. As home buyers, we naturally prefer something more long-lasting,"" she added.

&gt; Mr Kenyon Tan, 25, a first-time flat buyer who is self-employed, said the new fittings in HDBs will help new home owners spend less time trying to make their home more modern looking.

&gt; 

&gt; ""The main concern of buying a house is always money, especially for young people. I hope new improvements in HDB flats will not lead to a price increase,"" said Mr Tan.

&gt; But some were concerned about the new features.

&gt; Undergraduate Lim Zhi Xuan, 25, questioned how secure the new thumb-turn knobs will be compared to the old key locks.

&gt; ""Some improvements HDB can continue to make are adding more handicap-friendly features to BTO flats, like ramps at the main door,"" he added.

Since you seem to be planning for singlehood, the thoughts of leaving behind legacy and what not wouldn't be in your thoughts. Then the more money you have leftover after the purchase becomes important.

If you're super noob in financial investment, you might as well use all of your saving and cpf to pay for your house. This way, you can sleep well at night not worrying about paying mortgage.

If you know a bit about how cpf work and familiar with basic investment tools like mutual fund and willing to take some risk, you can take bank loan given you can pay 5% downpayment in cash. Find mortgage that can give a fix interest rate. Market situation is a bit unstable, so fix rate will give you fix installment every month until the period end (typically 2-3yrs). At the same time, use your excess money to invest. If you're lucky, you can get average annual return of 10% in the next 5-10 yrs. ",2018-03-08 03:18:07 UTC

In theory, if you can get higher yield from CPF+cash than the bank loan interest, you should take the loan. But this is in **theory** only. There are a few reasons why I don't agree with this reasoning:

* Saving up money in CPF is not the same as saving cash. CPF has far more restrictions on its use than cash.
* Current bank interest rates are unusually low. They are likely to go up eventually.
* There is always some risk with investment. The highest yielding almost risk free investment is SSB which I highly doubt will beat mortgage loan rates over 10 years.
* Finally, the feeling of being debt free is quite shiok. I know people like to talk about good debt and bad debt - and a housing loan is usually considered good debt - but once you are debt free, you can realistically quit your job anytime as long as you have some minimal savings. It is a bit irrational, but people who have cleared their mortgage loan usually tell me that it is one of the best feelings they have felt.",2018-03-08 01:00:24 UTC

However, if you need the cash right now and/or don't want your cash flow tied up in a mortgage, you can consider taking a loan. But based on numbers alone, you always pay in full cash if you can because the interest on the bank loan will always make the final amount paid much higher, comparatively. 

Furthermore, interest rates are likely to increase in the near future, so you are definitely going to pay more if you take a loan than if you pay full cash. How much more would depend on the type of interest rate for the bank loan you take, i.e. floating or fixed rate.

I won't really bother to calculate because I don't know your full situation, assets and liabilities, etc. But paying in full upfront _almost_ always trumps taking a loan because you will have to pay interest on that loan. Loans are taken because the majority can't afford all that cash upfront.

1) The power of compounding interest should not be underestimated. I’ve calculated that I am going to gain more from leaving my funds in CPF than staying debt free. 
2) CPF is an important component of my retirement plan. I see retirement funds as a untouchable sum that I have to save up. My own house is a luxury that I will buy only if I can afford it on top of the minimum sum I’m saving for my retirement.
3) I’m not so savvy at investments that I can get returns significantly better than what CPFSA offers (I’ve transferred a large part of my funds there). I can just about get abit above CPFOA levels but I have to spend quite a bit of time and effort. For me, growing my wealth with CPF is more reliable and requires much less effort. 
4) Buying your flat with cash doesn’t necessarily mean you’re ‘cashing out’ your cpf funds. If you decide to sell your flat/upgrade, you have to pay back the CPF funds you used PLUS OA level interest. If you can get a bank loan lower than the 2.5% CPF interest, obviously the loan is better. 
5) Anecdotally, I know of two couples of similar ages - one paid for their flat with CPF and the other didn’t. The couple that didn’t use their CPF have significantly more money in their CPF and will be able to withdraw quite a bit of money from their OA and SA soon. The other couple will only be able to withdraw 5k.

My CPF working mostly entry and mid-level supervisory jobs will be able to clear almost the entire cost of the flat.

Rough maths

- Flat Cost ~ 90k
- Single Fee* - +40k

Full price of Flat ~ 130k

- First Timer grant 40k

Amount Payable to HDB - 90k

- Current CPF ~70-80k
- CPF by the time I get my keys ~ 90k

Hence, when I get my keys, they wipe out my CPF and I don't owe them anything.  At most, I need to take a HDB loan of ~ 10k.

Just to be safe, I made sure to qualify and apply for the HDB loan.  It was pre-approved when I applied for the flat, so if I need a loan, the HDB loan will cover it.

From my PoV, if you've been working entry level jobs with CPF contributions since NS or since you left school, your CPF should be able to cover almost the entire cost of a 2 room BTO.  If you're a high flier, then confirm no issue.

Edit:  I just checked my CPF statement as I haven't checked it since I signed the agreement for the flat in 2016.  My current CPF balance is now more than the balance price of the flat I need to pay.  Hence, when they wipe out my CPF, I will still have some balance in it.

681c02c864b88e469caf91bb79e21f1a,"&gt; #3,300 singles handed keys to BTO homes since 2013: HDB

&gt; SINGAPORE - When she received her queue number to buy a Build-to-Order (BTO) flat in Punggol, design consultant Felicia Chan did not think she stood much chance of getting one.

&gt; ""It was quite a high number, considering the number of available units,"" said the 40-year-old, who applied for the flat in 2014. ""I thought I wouldn&amp;apos;t get it.""

&gt; However, later that year, the Housing Board (HDB) invited her to select a two-room unit in the non-mature estate - a type of flat which single people aged over 35 have been able to buy since 2013, thanks to a rule change.

&gt; After a three-year wait, Ms Chan received her keys last December, making her one of 3,330 singles who had bought flats and collected their keys as of the end of January this year, the HDB revealed on Saturday (March 3).

&gt; The HDB said that progress in meeting the housing needs of singles has been steady.

&gt; Before 2013, unmarried people could buy from only the resale market, until the Government allowed singles aged 35 and above to apply for new HDB flats in non-mature estates.

&gt; Last year, an average of 5.9 applicants vied for each two-room HDB flat, down from the 57.5 applicants in June 2013.

&gt; ""Over the last four years, the flat supply for two-room flats in non-mature estates has remained steady at an average of about 4,000 units per year,"" an HDB spokesman said.

&gt; About 12,200 singles have booked their new homes with the HDB.

&gt; Ms Chan said that she decided to get a flat because she wanted her own space.

&gt; She decided it was time to move out of her family home - a three-room flat in Ang Mo Kio - after her father died in 2013.

&gt; Renting out her room means more money for her mother too.

&gt; Punggol was a good location for her because it is not too far from Ang Mo Kio and Bishan, where her relatives live. ""I can be there quickly for my family if anything happened,"" said Ms Chan, whose new flat is being renovated.

&gt; Ms Chan is paying about $80,000 for her new place, after HDB grants.

&gt; About 8,500 singles who applied for a new two-room unit benefited from the Additional Central Provident Fund (CPF) Housing Grant and/or the Special CPF Housing Grant between July 2013 and January this year, said an HDB spokesman.

&gt; ""I was prepared to pay the whole sum, but HDB told me that I was eligible for the grants,"" Ms Chan said.

&gt; The spokesman said that the HDB will continue to monitor the demand and calibrate its supply of two-room flats to meet the housing needs of singles aged 35 and above.

Rather than relying on what everybody else says, have you asked her about what her specific issues and concerns are? 

Is she worried about getting along with the in laws? Does she want privacy when she eventually moves in with you rather than sharing a home with other people? That's totally understandable too. 

It's a big relationship stressor to move in together, let alone having to deal with in law tensions. It's also inherently unfair for her to move in with YOUR family because she's got to get used to your house rules, she's not on neutral territory when you guys have any disagreements, it doesn't feel like home for her but it does for you. 

Most of my friends have moved in with their husbands' families while waiting for BTO and without exception they have all hated it. 

Maybe you can compromise by renting while waiting for your BTO, or take turns staying over at each other's parents' homes? Or say, you're comfortable living apart for a year, but if it takes any longer than that, you need to figure out a way to live together.

Personally my bf and I went for the first batch of ROF (Aug2017) and we gotten a flat that is completing in Q12019 (but brought forward to Q4this year). Usually flats in ROF or SOBF are flats that are completing within 2 years I would say that this is a much shorter wait time. Do note that there are some flats that are already completed, but the hooha for admin procedures can still take quite some time. 

Also, the February Sales Launch has started, so you can check it out. ROF results will be out in 1 week, whereas BTO results out in 2 months.

Staying separately until you get your own flat is not unheard of. In fact, I had personally mooted that idea to my wife some time back but she was willing to stay at my parents' first. We have now got our own flat.",2018-02-05 08:43:56 UTC

So we rented a place together while saving up/looking for options. Eventually bought a resale EC  as it makes most sense financially. Still waiting, so we’re still renting at the moment.

Generally, she prefers me to stay over as her parents are much more older than mine.. and I don’t mind because her room has a queen sized bed 😂😂😂

but as you mentioned, if costs are too high (renting = waste money) then maybe you will be alright with living apart for however long it takes. Perhaps in the year before getting the keys she could move in with you?",2018-02-05 10:51:57 UTC

c5e6005508168112f7a3b55ffe16b9f0,"How old are you guys? Logistics aside, I really think you need to live together first before committing with anything, whether marriage or a home. Also, stop thinking about what is common or not common, or what *should* be the traditional way. This is 2018, do what is comfortable for the both of you.    
I've been living with my SO for over 2 years and honestly, if we ever get married, it'll just be for the formality or for getting a flat. I already feel like we are. And it should be that way. Marriage shouldn't be treated like this huge thing, there will be way too much pressure and expectations, especially if you haven't lived with each other.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Sorry for ranting and going off topic. Regarding logistics, since your GF thinks rental is a waste of money (although for me, privacy and living with my partner is way more important that money. Money can always be earned.) I think it is better for her to live with your parents since you said that her r/s with yours is better than you with hers.   
&amp;nbsp;    
also you stated that if she gets pregnant she's going to stay at her parents and without you? That's really insane. You need to be there for her! It is your child and she will not be able to cope with it alone. Her parents are probably in their senior years and she shouldn't be depending on them. ",2018-02-05 08:18:36 UTC
